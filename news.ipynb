It took four elections over two years for opposition parties to defeat Netanyahu, photographed in 2019. What comes next? Eight political parties—including the far-left, far-right and an Arab Islamist party—are part of a government led by conservative Naftali Bennett as prime minister and centrist Yair Lapid as foreign minister. If this government is still standing in two years, Lapid is slated to replace Bennett as prime minister, and Bennett will become interior minister. Neither man can make a policy decision without approval from the other—and neither can fire the other. The eight parties that make up this \"odd-bedfellows\" coalition have two things in common, writes Ian Bremmer: They wanted Netanyahu out of power, and they mean to keep him out.

The summit setting was designed to place the two leaders on equal footing, and emphasize the global power they each hold, @bybrianbennett writes from Geneva. At the start of their meeting inside the Villa La Grange, Putin was quick to point out that the summit was Biden\\'s idea. When Biden spoke, holding a notecard in his hands, he described the U.S. and Russia as \"two great powers,\" and said, \"I think it\\'s always better to meet face-to-face.\" In the meetings on Wednesday, which went for just over three hours but didn’t involve a meal together, the U.S. said it wanted to find places to work together, lay down clear consequences for Russian cyber attacks and malicious interventions in U.S. politics.

Unlike medical disciplines requiring a more hands-on approach—say, physical therapy or surgery—talk therapy has long seemed a natural and effective fit for telehealth. And by taking appointments off the therapist's couch and into patients' homes via their devices, advocates argued, telehealth could make counseling more accessible and convenient for everyone, with particular benefits for those who lived in health care deserts or who couldn't regularly drive back and forth to see a clinician. Then, of course, the pandemic hit, sending the U.S. health care system into a panic and shuttering clinics and private practices nationwide. Telehealth, once psychiatry's up-and-comer, was suddenly its lifeline. With impressive speed, a system built around face-to-face visits shifted almost exclusively online. By May 2020, 85% of the American Psychiatric Association's surveyed clinician members said they were conducting the majority of their sessions virtually, up from just 2% prior to the pandemic. If there was ever a time for teletherapy to shine, writes Jamie Ducharme, it was during the pandemic. But the data aren't so shiny. Read more at the link in bio.

Almost all of its major attractions are in the historic center. Its cruise port and proximity to seaside towns attracted hordes of day-trippers, who spent less money and flooded the city center. An influx of study-abroad students and \"lifestyle migrants\"—who come for a few months or years to work remotely—compounded the issue, says Claudio Milano, a professor in the social anthropology department of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. \"The city has grown to be seen as a place of leisure.\" Rents climbed and public services, such as waste management, came under pressure. Limits on new hotel construction and short-term home rentals, and rule changes like a ban on tour groups using electric scooters, haven\\'t allayed residents concerns. \"Before the pandemic, coexistence between locals and tourists, especially young people and those who come to get drunk, was very conflictive,\" says Antonio Martínez Gómez, president of the residents\\' association for the Raval, a central neighborhood. But the pandemic has also shown just how much cities like Barcelona rely on tourists, writes Ciara Nugent.

And it sees Ramos stepping into the shoes of his mentor Miranda, who was meant to play the lead role of Usnavi—a hardluck bodega owner with dreams of returning to the Dominican Republic—a decade ago, before the film slipped into development hell. The battles Miranda and others fought in that time resulted in a moment in which a face like Ramos' can be that of a leading man's—and Ramos hopes to do the same for a new generation.

Joan, the protagonist of 'Animal,' enters several bad and even dangerous relationships with men. After one of them kills himself in front of her, she packs up and moves from New York to Los Angeles in pursuit of a woman whom she believes holds a key to resolving some of her past trauma. In California, she faces oppressive heat and more controlling men, moving closer to snapping with each passing day. We know from the start that she will be driven to murder—it's written on the book's jacket. The only question is which jerk will fall victim. In the years following the MeToo movement, the question of what happens to abusers remains murky—in real life, some have been jailed, others have made comebacks. Many faced no real consequences. And the question of what happens to survivors remains almost entirely unexplored. How a survivor, particularly if they haven't seen restitution, moves on from the pain seems a ripe area of study for artists.

As a young photographer, he set out to counter that story, documenting first the vibrant urban styles of Johannesburg, then street fashion across the continent. \"I wanted to capture African images that did not exist on Google,\" he says. His early work, appearing on Tumblr and Instagram, earned him accolades as well as commissions, writes @arynebaker: in 2018 he photographed former U.S. President Barack Obama\\'s visit to Kenya, then Naomi Campbell in Nigeria and Beyoncé in South Africa. His meticulously styled editorial shoots and advertising campaigns, for companies like Absolut Vodka and Mini, offer a new narrative—one where his largely African subjects are bold, powerful and clad in cutting-edge fashion by Africa\\'s emerging designers. He uses color-saturated, pattern-filled portraits to challenge the stereotypes, he says, keeping away from animal prints and ceremonial garb. \"My work is about showing what Africa looks like now,\" he says, \"to cultivate a better understanding of what Africa is.\" Stuurman is among TIME\\'s newest class of Next Generation Leaders.

For a small group of VMI alums who had been pushing for change at the 181-year-old school, it was a victory—but only a first step. The four activists, men in their 40s, had all once considered themselves conservatives. A Marine officer, a corporate lawyer, a civil engineer and a former Fox News correspondent, they treasured their unorthodox college experience, from the intentionally dehumanizing freshman “ratline” to the nearly two centuries of military history. But the events of recent years had awakened them, like many Americans, to the injustice all around them, and they had come to see the school’s continuing veneration of its Confederate past as an embarrassing stain. In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, removing the statue, they believed, was necessary but not sufficient to root out the racism plaguing their alma mater. Many of their fellow grads did not agree. The ensuing controversy toppled the school’s leadership and imperiled its funding. An independent investigation, ordered by the state, is probing the racial climate on campus after reports of racist behavior, from lynching threats to the disproportionate disciplining of Black students. And the institutional resistance the change agents faced radicalized them. Their fight is a parable for our times, writes @mollyesque. Read more at the link in bio.

At least six have formally accused the 57-year-old before the Mexico City prosecutor’s office, Mexico City’s attorney general confirmed on May 24. Roemer has denied the accusations. Roemer’s alleged crimes are comparable in scope and style to those of Harvey Weinstein. Like the former film producer, Roemer’s power and status helped ensure his alleged victims’ silence. He also benefited from a legal system that practically guarantees impunity: according to one study, only 5% of sexual abuse or rape cases in Mexico end in a sentence. For years, Roemer’s accusers chipped away at the wall of silence that protects men, and especially powerful men, in a country where neither feminism nor the movement against gender violence had yet gone mainstream. When Itzel Schnaas roared her accusation in a nearly seven-minute Youtube video excoriating Roemer, it was amplified by their efforts on social media and WhatsApp to create a community of previously siloed victims.

Amid the rampage, Fletcher and her family left with nothing but the clothes on their backs. One hundred years later, Fletcher, the oldest known survivor, still lives with the trauma of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.

At the same time, our film critic Stephanie Zacharek writes, they were free in a way heroes are not. Their job was to behave badly, often with irresistible glamour on their side. (Hello there, Catwoman.) They could be just as compelling as heroes, often more so. But somewhere along the way, villains began to push their way to the foreground. Now we're stuck with villain backstories that are little more than rote exercises in psychological depth, stories that sap our imagination rather than igniting it. It's no longer enough to just accept, and revel in, a character's badness, allowing their miscreant behavior its own aroma of mystery. Now we get elaborate explanations of why and how, in stories that build an illusion of moral complexity even when, in reality, they risk nothing at all.

Siwe was such a gifted dancer that, at age 10, she received a scholarship to the extracurricular program at the prestigious Ailey School in her hometown of New York City. But Siwe was also often troubled. From early on, Siwe \"was very emotional, and would tend to cry a lot,\" Monsanto says in the quiet of the Harlem studio where she used to teach yoga and West African dance before the studio closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Siwe was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at the age of 9. Schoolwork worsened her anxiety. But, Monsanto says, most adults and peers in her daughter\\'s life didn’t have much awareness of mental-health issues, and were ill-equipped to help. \"What I would get from doctors was like, \\'Well, she\\'s a girl, you know, her period is starting\\'—dismiss,\" says Monsanto.

A veteran federal prosecutor and top immigration official, Alejandro Mayorkas has handled ethically fraught law-enforcement issues for most of his adult life. But this is a new kind of pressure. He inherited the mess left by the Trump Administration's anti-immigrant crusade and faces a surge of new border crossers. Then there's the continued business of enforcing the law, whether by cracking down on illegal immigration or deporting convicted criminals who've managed to slip in. Mayorkas' backers see him as the best candidate to help Biden achieve his goal of managing a broken immigration system through a mix of empathy and law enforcement. Mayorkas is the first immigrant and Latino to head the department and brings his lived experience as a Cuban refugee and son of a Holocaust survivor to the rollback of Donald Trump's most controversial policies.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was handcuffed on May 25, 2020, while Chauvin, who is white, pinned him to the ground by his knee for more than nine minutes. Floyd verbalized that he couldn't breathe more than two dozen times as he writhed face-down in agony, according to prosecutors and footage of the incident, which touched off a nationwide reckoning on race and the largest sustained mobilization against racial injustice in recent memory.

At an emergency meeting, Sahin urged a 40-member team to \"move with the speed of light\" toward the company\\'s new goal of developing a COVID-19 vaccine. The team, which grew to more than 200, worked nights and through holidays on Project Lightspeed, and after several weeks had produced 20 candidates.

The machinery of justice is once again asked how to respond when police officers end civilian lives—a disproportionate share of which are Black. But this week in metro Minneapolis, a rare police trial connected to one Black man's death could not conclude before another died. In Brooklyn Center, a diverse bedroom community of around 31,000 about 10 miles north of Minneapolis, the April 11 shooting of Daunte Wright, 20, by Kim Potter, a white police officer who has since resigned, has set off protests in both cities, as well as some property damage and looting. The National Guard, state and local law enforcement—equipped with guns, batons, tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs—have since been dispatched to restore what's known as order. And each morning in downtown Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, a white former police officer who in May 2020 used his knee to pin down another Black man, George Floyd, for over nine minutes, is on trial inside a courthouse encircled by concrete boundaries, chain-link fencing and citizen-soldiers dressed for war. Floyd's death was ruled a homicide. On April 14, county prosecutors confirmed their plans to file second-degree manslaughter charges against Potter, the day after Chauvin's trial judge said the case will likely go to jury next week.

In some cities like New Orleans, budget cuts have reduced sanitation department staff, so they’re able to do fewer curbside trash pickups. In other cities like Baltimore, high rates of COVID-19 among sanitation workers reduced the number available to pick up trash, so they stopped collecting bulk trash, suspended street sweeping and temporarily stopped cleaning vacant lots. This comes at a time when more people are home because of the pandemic and creating more residential garbage than in the past.

And despite the apartment’s substandard conditions (which her landlord disputed), she began fighting to stay because she and her kids had no other safe place to go. “My life right now is in two people’s hands: It’s in the government’s hands, it’s in my landlord’s hands,” says Farve in a new documentary for TIME after she received an eviction notice in September. “[I’m] stressed out. I barely eat.” For six months, filmmaker Kathleen Flynn followed the struggles of two single moms in New Orleans whose uncertain housing situations reflect what is happening around the country. The dire current reality is especially impacting women of color, who are often struggling to hold on to a safe place to live while also tending to their children’s most basic needs. The struggle is a grim echo of life after Hurricane Katrina, when Black women and families were slower to recover and permanently fled New Orleans in droves. For those who returned, many are reliving the trauma of housing instability, this time with the added risk of a deadly virus. Watch the full documentary at the link in bio.

However, Russia's leaders have taken little concrete action. In April, the Kremlin denied that domestic violence was a problem and claimed it had decreased, even as Russian organizations reported they were struggling to keep up with a spike in calls for help. With shelters across the country closed because of the pandemic, some women were even fined for violating quarantine rules by fleeing their abusers.

It’s the strongest action the company has taken against the armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, or indeed those in power in any nation. It is also the culmination of a years-long dance between Facebook and Myanmar’s military, which infamously used the platform to spread hate speech and disinformation about the country's Rohingya Muslim minority in the years leading up to 2017, in a campaign that ended in mass murder, rape and arson. Since then, Facebook has banned individual military leaders in Myanmar as well as prominent nationalists. It also poured resources into tackling hate speech and disinformation, and hired a dedicated staff in the country. But until Thursday it had not banned the military as an entity, perhaps in a bid to ensure it could retain continued access to Myanmar, where it is synonymous with the Internet for half the population.

Long ago, in an earlier epoch, as studies of Mars have shown, Jezero Crater was Jezero Lake, a 45 km (28 mi.) depression in the northern Martian hemisphere, writes Jeffrey Kluger. Not long after, however, Mars lost its magnetic field and thus 99% of its atmosphere and nearly all of its water, transforming the planet into the frigid desert it is today. The rover’s mission is set to last at least one Martian year—or two Earth years. But if Perseverance is anything like its sister rover Curiosity, which was landed on Mars in 2012, was also pegged for just two Earth years and is still hard at work, it could exceed that minimal mission by a decade or more.

Kendi (@ibramxk) that celebrates the power of Black art. “In this first Black History Month after the racial reckoning of 2020, I feel impelled to do what historians rarely do: mark history while the story is still being written,” Kendi writes. “We are living in a time when the white gaze remains ever present in American life, but is hardly dominant among today’s assemblage of courageous Black creators. We are living in the time of a new renaissance—what we are calling the Black Renaissance—the third great cultural revival of Black Americans, after the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, after the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Black creators today were nurtured by these past cultural revivals—and all those brilliant creators who sustained Black Arts during the 1980s and 1990s. But if the Harlem Renaissance stirred Black people to see themselves, if the Black Arts Movement stirred Black people to love themselves, then the Black Renaissance is stirring Black people to be themselves. Totally. Unapologetically. Freely.” The project features typography from Tré Seals, the founder of @vocaltype.co, who specializes in making type inspired by communities of color and social justice movements.

Who could imagine a virus that crashes the entire global operating system, or an attack that narrowly fails to decapitate the U.S. government? And the obvious answer? Anyone who was paying attention. Just as epidemiologists long warned of a pandemic, the insurrectionists helpfully advertised their violent intentions all over social media. The phrase storm the Capitol, unleashing countless QAnon furies, appeared 100,000 times in the month before the attack, according to Zignal Labs. Which means that it should have required no imagination to foresee an uprising that was planned, promised and promoted in plain sight. Maybe Jan. 6 was more a failure of moral imagination, of grasping what people are capable of. And that failure reflects the collapse of moral leadership that we have seen in the past year not just in our politics but in what should have been the shared national purpose of fighting a pandemic that threatened us all.

Public-health officials across the country, as well as many experts TIME spoke with, say there has been a similar lack of coordinated planning and infrastructure to distribute and administer vaccines at the local level. \"This vaccination program is complicated,\" says Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the CDC under President Barack Obama, \"and the way it\\'s gone so far is a microcosm of the 11 months of failed federal response.\" The Biden Administration\\'s new health leaders will come in with their own ideas for how to control the pandemic and answer the critical question of what went wrong.

Juan Martín, Aponiente’s resident biologist, knew the plant well. “I had been studying seagrasses for 15 years—but always from the standpoint of the ecosystem. It never occurred to me or anyone else studying it that it was edible.” That is, until León showed up one day at Aponiente with a printout of a 1973 article in Science documenting the diet of the Seri, hunters and gatherers of Sonora, Mexico, who have eaten eelgrass for generations. That began an ambitious plan for harvesting eelgrass from different coastal areas around Spain and transplanting it to the Bay of Cádiz.

The real threat to America may be not that this GOP can’t win elections but that it can. Read the full cover story at the link in bio. Photograph by @drewangerer—@gettyimages',\n",

George Floyd was killed in late May when the world was unusually tense, in the thick of mass unemployment and a global pandemic that disproportionately affected people of color. Almost immediately, activists sprang from their lockdowns to say, “Enough is enough.” Their work included the typical organizing of rallies, but the swell of public protests did something else too: it emboldened more people of color to speak truths they had understood for years but kept buried out of concern for repercussions. Suddenly, these stories gained traction unthinkable just a few weeks before. Office workers demanded their employers fess up to their own legacies of racial bias in the workplace. Everyday people demanded that friends and family come to grips with this history—and threatened to end relationships if they didn’t. “The Movement for Black Lives did a really good job,” says Oluchi Omeoga, co-founder of the Minnesota-based activist group Black Visions Collective. “They made it uncomfortable to be racist in this moment.” Omeoga and racial-justice organizers are TIME's 2020 Guardians of the Year.

President Trump has mocked the deadly virus as a media conspiracy and insisted it is on its way out, despite having contracted it himself.

While they clearly do not share a judicial philosophy, it seemed as though they considered each other formidable. Sidelined from campaign travel due to the hearing and at least one COVID-19 case on her staff, Harris has used her allotted time to make as big of a mark as she can from a bland conference room in her office in the Hart Senate Office Building. (The lighting in Harris' own office isn't suited for Zooms, an aide tells TIME.) Harris has done her best to make these appearances work to the campaign's advantage, trading some of her firepower from now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle for a milder tone now that she's on the ticket.

People who lose jobs or whose small businesses collapse could turn to farming or bushmeat hunting to make ends meet, accelerating the loss of biodiverse natural habitats and driving the illegal wildlife trade.” In the short term that means that veterinary care, endangered species rehabilitation programs and community education efforts have been curtailed.

Black Lives Matter activists, wearing black T-shirts or carrying black flags, and Trump’s supporters in red MAGA hats or T-shirts, sneered at each other against the plywood-brown backdrop of Kenosha’s boarded-up downtown. As racial justice activists marched peacefully through downtown to protest the President’s visit, chanting “No Justice, No Peace,” Trump supporter Rhonda Dutton stood to the side and yelled, “Shame on you!” Most Kenosha residents say that Blake’s shooting and the subsequent protests have done little to change anybody’s mind ahead of the November election. If anything, they say, it’s just entrenched both sides further. “I feel like it has mostly galvanized people in their opinions that they’ve already had,” says Austin Babel, 21-year old college student and server at a diner. “But I certainly think that it threw a wrench in into things as far as people’s opinions of the rioting and the looting, because it’s very very different when it comes to your city.” Read more by @charlottealter at the link in the bio.

Marine life produces 70% of our oxygen; 90% of global goods travel via shipping lanes. Over the past century, the ocean has absorbed 93% of the heat trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse-gas emissions. But we humans have also been squeezing life out of the sea. Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere have made the ocean more acidic, threatening food chains. Warming waters are not only killing sea life, they are also changing currents and affecting global weather patterns. Meanwhile we dump 8 million tons of waste into the ocean a year, in addition to agricultural and industrial runoff that poisons coastal areas. At the rate we are harvesting fish, by 2050 there will likely be more plastic than fish in the oceans. A 2019 report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without \"profound economic and institutional transformations,\" there would be irreversible damage to oceans and sea ice.

As the world came out of the Great Depression and World War II, the U.S. launched a rapid bid to remake the global economy—running on fossil fuels. In the first postwar years, Americans moved to suburbs and began driving gas-guzzling cars to work, while the federal government built a highway system to connect the country for those vehicles. The single biggest line item in the Marshall Plan, the U.S. government program that funded the European recovery, went to support oil, which ensured that the continent’s economy would also run on that fossil fuel. In 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sealed a deal with Ibn Saud, the first King of Saudi Arabia, trading security for access to the country’s vast oil reserves. Every U.S. President since, implicitly or explicitly, has continued that exchange. The coronavirus pandemic is the most significant disruption yet to the postwar fossil-fuel order.

            "“We are nearing three weeks since the election and President Donald Trump has yet to accept the reality that he has lost. While it's true he ran better than many pollsters predicted, it's also the case that this election wasn't particularly close. Trump won an historic 72 million votes. However, Biden won 78 million and virtually every vote was turned out by Trump—for and against him. Biden won 51 percent of the popular vote, a larger percentage than any Democrat since 1964. Trump's gumshoe lawyers continue to file—and lose—lawsuits of little merit. Given the historically large election turnout amidst an ongoing pandemic, this election was remarkably well run and free of fraud. But what is likely to happen is that slowly, silently, power will begin to slip away from the Commander in Chief. The process will speed up considerably once states begin to ‘certify’ the results of the election and Trump's lawsuits continue to fail. You already see the change. Trump may continue to fire his own people, but the discussion of future policy directions will lie with Biden's transition team and the president elect.” Hit the link in our bio to read more.

Trump would not be the first former president to attempt a comeback, though history has been unkind to those attempting a return to the highest office in the land – only one has succeeded. And Republicans should be particularly on alert—frequently enough, the former presidents have ended up as third party spoilers. Hit the link in our bio to read more.

Former President George W. Bush is among those of Trump’s predecessors to urge him to concede, telling him the outcome of the result has been clear. His younger brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, also congratulated Biden and said it was time to “heal deep wounds”—calling on the Democrat to lead the way in that. The Republican Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan is another prominent GOP figurehead to call on Trump to do so. Meanwhile, an open letter signed by 31 former GOP lawmakers was also released urging Trump to concede. Others have been more ambiguous by not directly supporting Trump’s claims but defending his right to pursue them. While others have simply commented on the importance of the integrity of democratic elections without specifically commenting on the outcome of the 2020 presidential vote.\n",

            "While Donald Trump is still refusing to acknowledge his electoral defeat, he and his supporters appear to be talking up a 2024 comeback. Trump would not be the first former president to attempt a comeback, though history has been unkind to those attempting a return to the highest office in the land – only one has succeeded. And Republicans should be particularly on alert—frequently enough, the former presidents have ended up as third party spoilers. Hit the link in our bio to read more.

            "While President Donald Trump refuses to concede the 2020 election, several top Republicans are saying it’s time for Joe Biden to have access to classified briefings as he prepares for a transition of power. Biden, who was projected the election’s winner on November 7, has yet to receive the president’s daily brief about pressing national security matters—an unusual restriction for a president-elect. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and John Thune (R-S.D.) told CNN that Biden should receive the intelligence information. Other Republicans who said Biden should have access to classified briefings were Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Their comments come a day after Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) told local radio station KRMG that he will “step in” if Biden doesn’t begin to receive the briefings.

According to Former Deputy Secretary James Byrne, Secretary of Veteran Affairs Robert Wilkie embarked on a mission to discredit the female veteran, citing the name of a U.S. congressman to help support his disparaging claims in an attempt to shut down her sexual assault allegations and attack her reputation. Byrne told Newsweek that his refusal to go along with the conspiracy contributed to his eventual ouster from the V.A. and a forced retirement. Hit the link in our bio to read more.

Over the course of January, international media took an increasing interest in the growing coronavirus outbreak as the virus spread around the world. Just two days later, with thousands of new cases confirmed in China, the WHO declared a \"public health emergency of international concern\" as the U.S. government warned Americans not to travel to China, and urged those in the country leave. Later in the year, on March 11—with the virus now confirmed on every continent except Antarctica—the WHO declared that the COVID-19 outbreak was now a pandemic. A year on, and lessons have been learned the hard way, with the future trajectory of the pandemic still far from certain.  Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n",

In the middle of the uncertainty, President Trump did what many election experts had feared: he falsely claimed he had won and, with no legal basis, said the vote counting should stop. Shortly after 2 a.m. on Nov. 4, Trump stepped up to a podium in the East Room of the White House, baselessly called the election \"a fraud on the American public\" and threatened to ask the Supreme Court to stop the lawful continuation of vote counting. (A note left on the presidential lectern reads \"Won Texas.\" He did.) Trump falsely touted a win in states, including North Carolina and Georgia, which were still too close to call at the time, and he said without evidence that a \"sad group of people\" were trying to disenfranchise his supporters. \"This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election,\" Trump said to a rowdy crowd. \"Frankly, we did win this election.\" No such declaration was supported by media projections. Joe Biden's campaign manager slammed Trump's statement, calling it \"outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect.\" Read more at the link in bio. Photographs by @pvanagtmael—@magnumphotos for TIME\n",

Trump, who has refused to concede and has not acknowledged Biden as the winner, spent the week alleging a range of voting irregularities on Twitter, claiming that they swung the election to his opponent. His campaign has called for recounts in several states and filed more than a dozen lawsuits in various state and federal courts. None of them would shift enough votes to change the outcome of the election, which Trump’s own government declared was “the most secure in American history,” writes Vera Bergengruen.

            "Paste4:“We will never give up, we will never concede!” President Donald Trump told the crowd of supporters he had summoned to Washington on Jan. 6. They heard him and obeyed. Within hours, a mob of self-styled revolutionaries waving Trump flags had stormed the Capitol. Scaling scaffolding and breaking windows, they filled the marble halls. Shots were fired inside the building as lawmakers and their staffs scrambled for cover and tear gas filled the Rotunda. For the first time since the Civil War, America would not have a peaceful transfer of power, writes @mollyesque. As Trump leaves office, his party is more split and defeated than it was before he arrived. But it would be folly to predict that the embarrassment Trump has brought spells doom for Republicans. Despite his loss, Trump notched millions more votes in 2020 than in 2016 and spurred unprecedented GOP turnout. The real threat to America may be not that this GOP can’t win elections but that it can. Read the full cover story at the link in bio. Photograph by @drewangerer—@gettyimages\n",

His younger brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, also congratulated Biden and said it was time to “heal deep wounds”—calling on the Democrat to lead the way in that. The Republican Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan is another prominent GOP figurehead to call on Trump to do so. Meanwhile, an open letter signed by 31 former GOP lawmakers was also released urging Trump to concede. Others have been more ambiguous by not directly supporting Trump’s claims but defending his right to pursue them.

While it's true he ran better than many pollsters predicted, it's also the case that this election wasn't particularly close. Trump won an historic 72 million votes. However, Biden won 78 million and virtually every vote was turned out by Trump—for and against him. Biden won 51 percent of the popular vote, a larger percentage than any Democrat since 1964. Trump's gumshoe lawyers continue to file—and lose—lawsuits of little merit. Given the historically large election turnout amidst an ongoing pandemic, this election was remarkably well run and free of fraud. But what is likely to happen is that slowly, silently, power will begin to slip away from the Commander in Chief. The process will speed up considerably once states begin to ‘certify’ the results of the election and Trump's lawsuits continue to fail. You already see the change. Trump may continue to fire his own people, but the discussion of future policy directions will lie with Biden's transition team and the president elect.” Hit the link in our bio to read more.
