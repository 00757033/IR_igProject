Growing up hearing the growls and hoofbeats of her brother in the labyrinth below the palace, and witnessing those sacrificed to his bloody appetite each year, this book is ultimately the story of Ariadne’s betrayal of her family and Crete when she reveals to her lover, Theseus, how to slay her brother the Minotaur.\n.\nIn a world ruled by ruthless gods, Ariadne knows all too well what drawing their attention can mean for her fate. - I CANNOT WAIT TO FINISH THIS BOOK (& then discuss with @the.lowreylibrary) 🤩\n.\nIf you love Greek mythology definitely pick this one up!",

But it is also very addictive making the eyes (iris + sclera) of those who consume it stained blue & has lethal withdrawal symptoms.\n.\nThe spice is fundamental for commerce & is necessary for space travel by enabling navigators to safely guide space ships through warp space. The spice can only be harvested on Arrakis, and therefore is heavily valued, capable of sustaining or destroying the empire.\n.\nHowever, Paul & the Atredies family have been brought to Arrakis under false pretenses & are betrayed. The destruction of his family and his people sets Paul along a journey towards his destiny of becoming the mysterious ‘Muad’Dib’ and leading the Arrakis natives, The Fremen.\n.\nThis book is sci-fi gold. I loved it so much. I will say the first couple chapters are extremely dense and therefore slow, as Herbert dumps the reader into a whole new world with strange names, words and hierarchies. You WILL NEED THE APPENDIX! I was so intimidated by the first few chapters because I had no idea what was going on - but I’m so glad I pushed through and continued to read. I also watched a small crash-course on YouTube of how the world of Dune is set up/how it came to be - really helped me out.\n.\nAfter pushing through the confusion, this book has so many amazing things about it: a coming of age story that tackles politics, religion, environmentalism and climate change. It is good vs evil & has deep characters that are interesting to explore and love. Plus is has giant sandworms that you can ride (if you’re skilled enough not to die first). This book is the cornerstone of science-fiction. 🏜 can’t wait for the film adaptation!",

            "text": "Catch-22 ✈️ Joseph Heller\n.\n“Open your eyes, it doesn’t make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who’s dead.” \n.\nThis story follows Yossarian, a young bombardier in the United States Army stationed in Italy during WWII. Yossarian is trying to make it through the war alive, and is absolutely furious that there are so many people (most that he doesn’t know) trying to kill him.\n.\nYossarian quickly discovers that it is not just the Nazi Germans who are out to get him, but the leaders of his own squadron who continue to raise the number of combat missions men must fly before they can be sent home. Then, of course there is the catch, Catch-22.\n.\nCatch-22 states that any man that is deemed to be insane can be grounded and not fly anymore combat missions, but concern for one’s own safety in the face of danger is the process of a rational mind.\n.\nIn summary, a soldier who continues to fly into combat of his own accord is considered crazy and is eligible to be grounded, all he has to do is ask. BUT, as soon as that same soldier asks to not fly anymore missions, he would no longer be crazy and would therefore have to fly more missions. \n.\nThis book is without a doubt one of the most bitterly hilarious, wonderfully witty novels I have ever read. Full of satire and cynicism this book portrays and exposes the insane world of war and the military mindset. This book shows the side of war the general public fails to think about: how it unhinges and flips morals, what’s right and wrong - everything you think you know - upside down. So many important and serious themes emerge through the satire and humor as our narrator, Yossarian, attempts to make sense of the war which in and of itself is senseless. \n.\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Catch-22. I laughed out loud many times and used tons of stickies to mark notable quotes. While this book isn’t perfect, being repetitive and harder to follow all the characters in the beginning & the flow of the book can be hard to get into at times, I’ve never read a single book like this & I’m very happy to add this American classic novel to my read pile. 4 ⭐️",

Misery & despair have dominated her years and she can never shake the feeling that she’s repeatedly let everyone in her life down, including herself. On one particularly bad day, Nora decides to end it.\n.\nHowever, as Nora comes to find out, between life & death there is a library - The Midnight Library, to be exact, with the librarian being a beloved individual of her past. The Midnight Library houses endless volumes - all different versions of how your life could have been if you’d made different choices.\n.\nNora begins to explore the library’s contents firsthand, able to transport directly into these parallel/perpendicular universes, where she attempts to undo each decision she’s ever regretted. But she does not have forever to decide. Before time runs out she must choose: which is the perfect life? What is the best way to live?\n.\nOkay, this will without a doubt be one of my favorite books in 2021. This story is quick paced (I read in less than 24 hours), heart-felt, and offers very important lessons about your outlook on life. As someone who constantly wonders how my life could’ve turned out differently if I made different choices, this book hit special with me. With nods to great philosophers, Haig explores the meaning of life & provides important insight which the reader can carry forward into his/her own life.\n.\n“It is easy to mourn lives we aren’t living. Easy to wish we’d developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we’d worked harder, loved better, handled finances more astutely, stayed in the band, said yes to coffee or done more bloody yoga...it’s easy to regret, and keep regretting...until our time runs out.”",

The curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum and left a cipher which has the French police absolutely baffled.\n.\nJoined and aided by the French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, Langdon begins to reveal a trail of many clues hidden, several in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci right inside the museum. But with Langdon being the prime suspect of the curator’s murder, there is not much time to sit and think.\n.\nAs clue after clue reveals more information, Neveu and Langdon discover that the curator was a member of the Priory of Sion - an ancient secret religious society whose main purpose is to protect an extremely important religious relic - most importantly keeping it out of the hands of the Catholic Church.\n.\nIn a heart-racing chase that leads from Paris to London, Langdon and Neveu work to discover the answers to the puzzle, all the while being hunted by the French authorities & an Opus Dei (Catholic extremist) monk. If the secret falls into the wrong hands, it will be lost forever.\n.\nSo, I figured it was about time I read this controversial book! Growing up in the Christian faith, I was curious to see what had everyone buzzing about this book many years ago. My mom advised me before I began to simply read this book for what it is, which is FICTION. And I personally enjoyed this story tremendously.\n.\nI absolutely loved the setting: Europe has my heart so I enjoy any book set in that continent. Secondly, I LOVE a good treasure hunt where a series of clues must be solved. As far as how the Catholic faith is portrayed, again, this book is fiction & I don’t think Brown was encouraging readers to go away from the faith. He simply was creating a story of something that could have been, expanding the possibilities of reality and religion.\n.\nSummed up, this book was witty & extremely fast-paced with short chapters that allowed me to race through & there is a ton of historical, art and religious history that I absolutely loved learning more about.",

If you have yet to jump on the Hamilton fan train, definitely listen to some of the music and see how you like it. It’s so carefully and creatively crafted with every single line serving a specific purpose, it’s impossible not to be impressed.

BUT, Mark Watney is miraculously alive & all alone with no way to signal to Earth that he survived.\n.\nHis only chance of rescue are the Ares 4 mission due to land on Mars in 4 years. But his supplies will run out way before that date and he’ll starve...if the unforgiving Mars environment and failing equipment don’t kill him first. Mark is forced to put his mechanical engineering & botany skills to work to stay alive and find some way of communication.

It shows you the very worst and the very best of humanity & to conquer evil, sometimes good must be sacrificed. One of the scariest thoughts I had is what side would most people choose if this happened today? I’d like to think good would win out, but, that’s also not guaranteed. \n.\nALL THE STARS for this door-stopper of a book ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",

I don’t believe King has ever had a thought that is less than 500 pages 😂\n.\nThis is the first time I’ve tackled a novel over 1,000 pages & I was very intimidated at the start. But, I should’ve known I’d fall head first [down the rabbit hole, if you may] into this story. I’ve loved all my past experiences reading King & I’ve heard from many that this is his best work. I have definitely been blown away.\n.\nI have mixed feelings about being so close to the ending! I really don’t want this story to end, yet I am very anxious to find out what happens. Looking forward to reviewing this book soon!\n.\nAlso, to all my book friends out there that have been wanting to tackle a 1000+ page book, GO FOR IT! You may be pleasantly surprised how quick it reads & it will definitely give you a sense of accomplishment [& an arm workout!] 💪🏼📚",

Mr. Poe, a banker who always has a persistent cough, is in charge of their affairs and places them in the care of their [extremely] distant relative Count Olaf. The Count is a Villanous, Foul, Dishonest man (who believes himself to be a handsome/talented actor which is just not the case) whose main motive is scheming to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune.\n.\nThroughout the books, the orphans travel from relative to relative only to find that misfortune and despair follow them everywhere & Count Olaf is always a step behind them making their lives more & more dangerous & miserable with each scheme. Only with Violet’s keen inventing mind, Klaus’s wonderful research talents & Sunny’s dental/cooking abilities are the children able to [barely] escape Olaf’s clutches each time. \n.\nAs the list of unfortunate events, murdered guardians, mysteries surrounding V.F.D. - a secret organization that the Baudelaire parents were part of - & sinister tattoos of eyes on ankles, which may stand for something noble or treacherous, the Baudelaire orphans wonder if their lives will ever be cheerful again. \n.\nThis series will take you, the reader, into the stormy waters of Lake Lachrymose with man-eating leeches, into a horrible school where the vice principle does not know how to play the violin but insists on doing so anyways, down a pitch black elevator shaft to rescue triplets, into a run-down carnival with starved lions, through the tallest mountains & the deepest caves of the sea - & if you decide to continue reading, which the author will advise you against - good luck, my Valued Fortunate Distingushed friend.",

Thus, Mamabare was born.\n.\nFast-forward a few years & add 1 million + followers & adoring fans, Mamabare is the platform Emmy connects to the millions of mums seeking solace in someone who gets what they’re going through. It is also Emmy and her washed-up novelist husband, Dan’s large source of income. But, Dan has always been hesitant about Emmy being so open about their family life and sharing many pictures of Coco and Bear online - fearful of what trolls and obsessed fans could do.\n.\nAs Emmy and her Instagram success grow, the more superficial and insensitive she becomes & the fragile facade of her marriage and family life threatens to crack. It also becomes clear that one of her many followers wishes her harm & lurks ever nearer, threatening to ruin all Emmy is.\n.\nThis book was a different kind of creepy and I enjoyed it for that reason. It explored the darker side of social media and the dangers of the information we post online. It brought to light how superficial social media life is: often staged, overly-filtered, over-exaggerated, with fake smiles. After reading this, I definitely realize how I myself live life through my camera lens at times & understand the need to be more present. It also reinforced the chilling fact that in making our lives public, we invite not only our friends & family to see, but also strangers who do not always have the best intentions.\n.\nALSO big shoutout to @nicklausaltomare who captured his creepy shadow in the pool reflection without even meaning to 😂 (SWIPE to see up close) It worked perfectly for this book! #toothfulreviews",

But this fish doesn’t run from anything. He doesn’t fear.”\n.\nDA DUM...DA DUM... The town of Amity is under attack by a man-eating shark. Bodies (well parts of bodies) wash up on shore, people go missing, some even witness the attacks. Chief of Police, Brody wants the beaches closed until they can be sure the shark is gone but many others, especially the mayor, push for the beaches to remain open. Here’s why: if Amity closes its beaches this summer, the town may as well be dead - for the locals of Amity survive the rest of the year off the profits they make from the rich-folk spending their summers there.\n.\nAs more victims are claimed by the shark, the town doesn’t have a choice. The shark must be killed. Hooper, a young ichthyologist comes to help & him and Brody employ Quint (a hardcore fisherman) and his boat to catch the water devil. However, this Great White is unlike any other shark - smart & cunning - and promises to not die without a fight & claiming more victims.\n.\nAfter watching and loving the movie growing up, I was nervous reading the book, worried it wouldn’t live up to Spielberg’s film masterpiece. Now, I still like the movie more than the book but, I did enjoy reading this horror story. The book had more dark subplots to it that the movie eliminated including an affair (which I could’ve done without) & the mafia. I wish Quint’s character would’ve been developed better in the book, i liked his role in the movie more. Also, there were larger boring chunks where no one was getting eaten and I was upset lol but when action was happening...It was gory and exciting. \n.\nOverall, I’m very happy I decided to read the book that goes along with a favorite movie of mine! (INNER TUBES WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS PHOTO)\n.\n& always remember, “you’re gonna need a bigger boat”🪝🦈 #toothfulreviews",

And if you were of the lucky sort, sometimes that life chose you back.”\n.\nTHIS BOOK WARMED MY HEART 💙 easily one of my favorites of this whole year & quite possibly of my new all-time favorites.\n.\nLinus Baker is a caseworker for The Department in Charge of Magical Youth & is good at what he does. Every magical child must be registered and accounted for, living in orphanages until they can get their power under control. Linus’s job is to make sure the orphanages are safe and the children are being well cared for, otherwise he recommends they get shut down.\n.\nAt the age of 40, Linus is content, I guess. He has his old Victoria records, his sunflowers, his devious cat, Calliope & his picture of the sea (which he’s never actually seen before) with words underneath the picture reminding him everyday: “don’t you wish you were here?” But he doesn’t know what he’s missing - until one day his whole life changes.\n.\nLinus is summoned by Extremely Upper Management and given a vague, extremely classified new assignment that takes him to a far-away island with, perhaps, the most secret orphanage, in which resides 6 of the most dangerous magical children. His job is simple, observe and report for 1 month & determine if the orphanage should remain open.\n.\nLinus is greeted by the most unique & enigmatic individuals, being most intrigued by the master of the orphanage - Arthur Parnassus - whom [it’s clear from the beginning] will do everything in his power to keep the children safe, no matter the cost to himself. Linus finds the more time he spends on the island, the closer he becomes to its inhabitants & the the less objective he is able to be in his reports, which was a MUST according to Extremely Upper Management. \n.\nLinus learns many things throughout his time on the island & you as a reader will too - finding parallels between this magical world and ours. I promise you will fall in love with all of the children & feel protective of them yourself. This book evokes powerful emotion because Klune makes the reader feel like part of the family. ❤️",

Because happiness is brief and history is lasting, and in the end ... everyone wants to be remembered.” \n.\nGrowing up, Adeline LaRue was told not to pray to the gods who answer after dark unless she be willing to trade more than simple trinkets. But desperate situations arise & Addie ends up selling her soul to the devil in exchange for immortality & freedom. He may have her soul when she is done with it, but there is a catch: she cannot be remembered by anyone she meets. She cannot make relationships, cannot write or draw or be captured in photos. She cannot do anything that would allow her to make a mark on the world or another person. \n.\nEach year on the anniversary of her deal, the darkness returns to ask if she is ready to give up her soul - a way to leave the pain of constantly being forgotten by everything and everyone. But Addie is stubborn and determined to find excitement and happiness despite the limits of her curse. This book is a beautiful account of her life spanning across centuries & countries.\n.\nI know there has been a lot of hype surrounding this book & some have been let down. I am not one of those. I was completely enchanted by this book. Not only was the prose in and of itself, beautiful, but the entire essence of this story as well. The richness of the history, the excitement of travels across Europe, the amazing character development & the sweet, steady romance between star-crossed lovers are only a few of my favorite things I can name about this book.\n.\nThe book did lag at times, but this didn’t diminish the impact for me. The fact that the chapters are short made it easier to push through the slower ones & I absolutely loved that the story bounced from present day and Addie’s past encounters with the darkness.\n.\nAgain, this book might not be everyone’s favorite. But, I know for a fact it has become one of mine. It’s the first book in quite some time that I’ve felt sad to finish & had the urge to start again immediately. I will be talking about Addie for a long time.",

They do this by the concept of “Sameness.” The society functions by homogenizing its citizens daily activities, family unit, job assignments, experiences, etc. There are no colors or emotions. Spouses are assigned, as well as jobs (when you turn 12), and each family can apply for 2 kids. What Jonas comes to realize is that all emotion, passion, pain and love have been cut out in order to achieve a peaceful society.\n.\nEverything changes when Jonas turns 12 & is selected as being the next “Receiver of Memory” - the highest and most special honor, but not a coveted position for it is also one of isolation and pain & Jonas is forbidden to discuss his training with anyone. After being taught by the previous Receiver, who is now considered “The Giver,” Jonas begins to question the society he lives in, and feels the veil has finally been torn off his eyes. Is the sacrifice really worth what has been gained? \n.\nThis book is eye-opening & depressing but it shows how valuable individuality & raw emotion is. Yes, it causes war, suffering, loss and poverty, but it is also the reason we are able to love and enjoy our life. If one never experiences sadness or pain then one can never truly be happy. Without these things, life really does become meaningless. #toothfulreviews",

I {quite literally} could not put this book down - it was THAT good.\n.\nIn case you don’t know the plot for this story: a very wealthy man named John Hammond has devoted millions of dollars to open his new “theme park” on an island in Costa Rica in which visitors can come experience dinosaurs - a true interaction with the past.\n.\nHammond has hired the most ambitious scientist, engineer & staff to make his dream come to life. Extracting dinosaur DNA from insects, preserved in amber, who drank Dino blood & then cloning them to make the real deal, adding in bits of other DNA when needed. What could possibly go wrong with creating animals that we have absolutely no idea about?\n.\nThe book takes place a few months before the park is to be open to the public. Funny things have been going on & some of the investors are questioning the secrecy surrounding the mysterious project they’ve paid lots of cash into - they want to know what truly goes on inside Jurassic Park & they have sent a lawyer to investigate.\n.\nHammond, in an effort to save his own a$$ & show that nothing sketchy could possibly be happening - invites a paleontologist, paleobotanist, mathematician (specializing in chaos theory) and his two grandkids to the island to show off his greatest achievement. Everything looks well organized from the outside - until an internal conspiracy, main control power outage, de-electrified safety fences & a severe underestimation of dinosaur behavior wreck havoc on the visitors and staff. Can they ever get off the island alive? \n.\nAgain, LOVED this book so much. Perfect combo of science fiction & thriller plus a little gore for fun. Crichton did amazing at making facts and scientific terms enjoyable to read. This book is a fun read but also makes the reader question how far science can and SHOULD go - pushing boundaries anywhere will always have consequences. #toothfulreviews",

Under this religious totalitarian system each person has their place.\n.\nUnder Gilead’s rule, Handmaids are fertile women considered to be morally “impure” in some way. They take the name of their commander thereby giving up their own. Handmaids are given to high ranking leaders in Gilead so that children may be born to the family. \n.\nUnder this totalitarian patriarchy, women are forbidden to read and write. We experience Gilead through our Handmaid narrator, Offred, as she navigates the horror that is her new reality. Once a month she must lie on her back and pray the Commander makes her pregnant. She only has value if her ovaries are viable. If she fails to get pregnant after a certain time, it’s off to the radiation poisoned colonies - which is certain death. The Republic of Gilead is harsh and unforgiving. \n.\nThis is such an iconic dystopian novel & I enjoyed devouring every page of it. I had watched the Hulu series before reading so I knew the plot, but I still really enjoyed reading the book! \n.\nSome people have mentioned that this book is frustrating because Atwood doesn’t give a lot of answers to explain how Gilead came about, what’s really going on in the world, etc. However, I think this was deliberate. Offred didn’t have much information, she couldn’t risk discussing such topics, so the limits of our knowledge aligned with those of Offred’s and overall helped add to the mysterious & disturbing tone of this book.\n.\nPRAISE BE! I cannot wait to read The Testaments now! So glad I didn’t have to wait years for a sequel!\n.\nUnder His Eye 👁 #toothfulreviews",

For the rest of the story, Josef must find ways to defend himself against this mysterious charge of which he can get absolutely no information about. He has no idea why he’s under arrest & being tried - he just knows it’s not a joke & his life depends on the outcome.\n.\nThis novel is first and foremost a warning against totalitarian government and the excess of bureaucracy. I think what made this book so chilling is how closely the story adhered to reality. There was no twisting or blown-out-of-proportion concepts or ideas. Everything was very believable & the ideas surrounding the government and the legal system hit close to home. \n.\nCourt proceedings obscured by other court proceedings. Responsibility of explanation deferred to some unidentified “higher-up” judge or court officials. Innocent until proven guilty? More like guilty until proven less guilty & becoming less guilty relies more on “who you know” rather than hard evidence.\n.\nThis book was slow at times throughout, but when it picked up it held my attention unwaveringly. The best way I can describe reading this book is that it feels like someone is sitting on your chest and your breath is slowly leaking out of your lungs leaving you gasping at the air but cannot get new air in. Its a slow realization that innocence & logic don’t always prevail over a powerful, corrupt system.\n.\nKafka’s vision of the future is the nightmare of our existence - trying to apply logic and fact to the absurd. When justice is compromised and those who are sworn to uphold it are corrupt - in what can the people put their faith in to rebalance the scales? #toothfulreviews",

To make matters even worse for Hamlet Jr. -  Claudius married his mother (that’s right - married his own brother’s wife)\n.\nHamlet fakes madness while growing increasingly more eager to expose his uncle’s murderous conspiracy. He contemplates life & death, all the while seeking revenge...coming to find all too late that revenge itself is deadly. His own obsession may be his own downfall.\n.\nI’ll begin by saying reading anything by Shakespeare has always intimidated me. I’ve never read anything by him without the help of an English professor to legitimately walk me through each line 😂 so starting Hamlet by myself made me nervous! Now, I’m very happy I took on the challenge!\n.\nI give all the praises to the Barnes & Noble editions of Shakespeare’s work - they give you explanations & differing word choices for each page as you’re reading, making it so much easier to understand and enjoy!\n.\nUltimately, I think every once-in-a-while we should pick up books that challenge us. I don’t necessarily mean that everyone needs to pick up Shakespeare or read a book that is of NO interest to them. What I mean is, don’t keep yourself from reading a book just because you are intimidated & feel you won’t understand.\n.\nBooks will always mean different things to different people. If you’re interested in a book that intimidates you, I encourage you to pick it up and try! You may be pleasantly surprised as I was with Hamlet. I look forward to reading more of Shakespeare’s work especially since Barnes & Noble Shakespeare is here to help me! #toothfulreviews",

Rather, they find their escape salvation in the OASIS: an expansive virtual reality universe created by the eccentric genius, James Halliday.\n.\nThe book begins with the death of Halliday & the announcement of his [will-be-famous] contest to find a digital Easter egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS. The first person to complete the quest will inherit Halliday’s multi-billion-dollar fortune.\n.\n5 years have gone by with no avatar user making an progress towards finding the Easter egg.

If he wants to survive, he need to win & the race to the finish is on. He needs his vast knowledge of the 1980’s pop culture, near- perfect video gaming skills & help from some unlikely friends to win the ultimate prize.\n.\nWow. I mean WOW. I absolutely LOVED this book so much, so much more than I expected to! This whole book felt like playing in a video game universe & it was beyond fun to experience. I cannot wait to watch the movie & for the second book [Ready Player Two] that comes out this month!\n.\nIf you want a book that’s easy to follow, is consistently fast-paced and action packed then you will love this book!

She instantly knows this baby is special by her half moon-shaped birthmark - the mark of a naturally born witch. Hannah names the baby Maria & raises her as her own & teaches Maria all she can about the “Natural Art.” The most important lesson she gives Maria, is about love - “Always love someone who will love you back.”\n.\nAs the story progresses, we follow Maria as she grows up & moves to the American colonies during the dangerous time of the Salem Witch Trials, where no woman or girl is safe in Massachusetts. We are with Maria as a young girl who naively falls in love & is betrayed by a deceitful man, thereby swearing off love forever. We are there as she foolishly invokes a curse that will affect the Owen women’s’ bloodline for generations to come. She may find out too late that true love is the only thing that matters.\n.\nGUYS!!! I’m going to be talking about this book for a LONG time & I would not be surprised if this is my favorite book this year. Also NEW FAVORITE AUTHOR ALERT 🚨 \n.\nThis is the unforgettable prequel to Practical Magic & The Rules of Magic, but if you’re like me & have not read the other books in the series - DON’T LET THAT DETER YOU! You don’t need prior knowledge to read & fall in love with this story! I can’t wait to read the other two 😍 I cannot say this enough - READ THIS BOOK!!! #toothfulreviews",

The family soon learns that sometimes, dead, is better.\n.\nCOMA: A young medical student, Susan Wheeler, attempts to get to the bottom of what she believes to be a horrible conspiracy at Memorial Hospital. Patients are going in for routine, minor surgery and coming out in an inexplicable, irreversible brain death. Devoting herself to finding answers may just be the last thing Wheeler ever does.\n.\nAND THEN THERE WERE NONE: 10 strangers arrive at a remote island off the Devon coast invited by a mysterious host none of them have actually seen. Their host is nowhere to be found, but he/she knows more than enough about each guest’s wicked past. Each guest has been accused of murder and before the weekend is out secrets will be revealed and one by one they begin to die. Only the dead are above suspicion.\n.\nCUJO: a big, loving St. Bernard dog chases an animal into an underground hole only to be bitten by a rabid bat.

The House with the Ocean imprisoned in it & where 15 people reside - 13 dead & 2 living - Piranesi and The Other. \n.\nPiranesi has weekly meetings with The Other, who is searching for A Great and Secret Knowledge which will grant him ancient powers. Piranesi, who has a grand understanding of The House, it’s ocean tides & endless statues, helps with The Other’s research & lives to explore the endless rooms. Until one day, evidence of a 16th person in The House appears & everything Piranesi has ever known is threatened.\n.\nThis book was so good!😭 It was written beautifully through Piranesi’s journal entries and the fantasy concept was so intriguing. If you are going to read this book, I suggest you dive in as I did - without any prior knowledge of what this book is about. Stick with the story through the first 15 pages of confusion and complexity - the House will reveal all you need to know as you go along ✨ so go in blinded & see what Piranesi’s world has to offer!\n.\nPS - I apologize my fingers are literally covering the title 🙄\n#mybookfeatures #toothfulreviews",

A breath of fresh air in the country. A chance to enjoy themselves. This is what Amanda & Clay believe the week holds for themselves & their kids Archie & Rose.\n.\nWhat they don’t expect? A late night knock at the front door revealed to be a husband & wife who claim to be the owners of the house. They bring with them news that a blackout has swept through NYC & the East coast. They drove all night in a panic to have shelter here. They need to be let inside. They need to stay until they know more information. Is it a fluke or is it the end of the world? The 2 families are left to wait this question out together with no phone service, no news. Just increasing paranoia & distrust of each other and the world as they know it.\n.\nLet me start by saying, if you like your book endings all tied-up in a perfect bow - this book is NOT for you. Personally? I appreciate an unsatisfying, “think-for-yourself” ending. It’s uncomfortable. It’s realistic.\n.\nThis book slowly creeped me out but nothing outright scary happened. My growing sense of unease grew with the characters - increasing to down right panic at times, nervously glancing over my shoulders and wondering what the f*ck was going on. I felt the author did a great job of making me feel like I was trapped in that house right along with the characters.\n.\nThroughout, I felt the prose & sentence structure were overwritten and frustrating to understand at times - the detail, mostly in the beginning, felt distracting from the story. But, overall I think the author did an amazing job at transporting me as a reader into the story and not just an outsider looking in.\n.\n🦷⚠️: PS, if you don’t like teeth or things happening to teeth - don’t read. As a [future] dentist though, I personally loved it & felt it added perfectly to the “what the f*ck-ness” (probs not a word) of this story.\n#mybookfeatures #toothfulreviews",

Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five. One of America’s classic anti-war novels that, once again, appears more simple on the surface yet tackles many important subjects including PTSD, soldiers reintegrating into society after war & the horrors of war.\n.\nThis book is crazy. Throughout, we follow Billy Pilgrim, a WWII veteran, as he time-jumps from moment to moment throughout his life. The central story is Billy’s experience as an American prisoner of war & ultimately ends with the devastating bombing of Dresden, Germany.\n.\nNow, I know I mentioned aliens - but this is by no means a science fiction novel! The way Tralfamadorians [4D alien species - green & plunger-shaped, resembling a hand with an eye at the center] fit in is this: They kidnap Billy & put him in a zoo on their planet to study him. To the Tralfamadorians, time is not linear. All moments are forever occurring, at all times and you can jump from moment to moment. This is how the story is set up as we follow Billy’s time-jumping through his life moments.\n.\nWhat I appreciated most about this book is it’s dark humor, satire & Vonnegut’s ability to write about such heavy concepts in light, straightforward way. War is a subject humans don’t like to think incredibly deeply about - it’s a subject that offers disturbing and horrifying secrets. Yet, it’s so important to understand the reality of PTSD & how the ones who fight for their country are inevitably changed forever as a result.\n.\nThese newspapers are ones my grandpa (who fought in WWII) saved. One is from 1945, when Japan surrendered & the other is 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell.\n#mybookfeatures #toothfulreviews",

I cannot stress enough how she makes a classic, well-known story feel captivating & new - rushing through the pages to figure out how it ends, even though I already know.\n.\nThis story is a different take on Homer’s Iliad - the story of the Trojan War, the fight to win back Helen of Sparta and of course Aristos Achaion, the best of the Greeks, Achilles. However, the story’s point of view is from Patroclus, an exiled prince, with whom Achilles has an inseparable bond.\n.\nI think one of the reasons I enjoyed this story so much [aside from the beautiful prose] is because Miller made it easy for me to learn and enjoy this story without much prior Iliad knowledge. That takes skill. I seriously can’t recommend this book & Circe enough. Also bring your tissues for this one. Easily all the stars for me 😍\n.\nWhat could make this book even better?

On the 85th day of his fishing dry-spell, the old man is pulled out to the open sea in the Gulf of Mexico after hooking a giant marlin. On the surface, this story is about the relentless, challenging battle between the old man & the fish. But it’s meaning also runs much deeper.\n.\nThis was my first read of Hemingway & let me start off by saying the prose was absolutely beautiful. I also enjoyed the underlying themes of this short novel: the role of luck in one’s life vs skill and perseverance, the reality of growing old, respect and reverence for nature, tenacity in the face of inevitable defeat & what really defines success. I believe this simple story has some important lessons to offer the reader.\n.\nI like this book much more after thinking about its meaning for a few days than I did right after reading. I had to work a little bit to get some depth from this story so I tried to analyze it like I was reading a book for school. I think this is a story that the reader chooses how much he/she wants to read into it & certainly would mean different things to an individual at different milestones of life. #toothfulreviews",

My head is swarming with thoughts about this book and it’s been difficult to find the right words to talk about this powerful, powerful story.\n.\nGifty, a Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience at Stanford School of Medicine, has devoted the last 5 years towards researching reward-seeking behavior in mice and the neural circuits involved in addiction. Having lost a brother to a heroin overdose years earlier when a sports injury left him hooked on pain pills and looking after her depressed mother who is wasting her life away in bed, Gifty is determined that hard science can provide the answers to all of her unanswered questions. Throughout her research, Gifty struggles with reconciling her devoted, religious childhood self, preserved in journal entries, with the secular, scientific self she is today. This story is one of loss, addiction, grief and struggles with faith.\n.\nThis story hit extra special for me. I related very closely with Gifty’s research into addiction, reward seeking behavior and the brain because I completed my undergraduate honors thesis researching a very similar issue. The opioid epidemic and heroine overdoses are very real issues that the United States has been battling for a long time. For me, as a future dentist, I wanted to know how my future profession fit into the problem. A large amount of people have their first experience with narcotics from a dentist (for wisdom teeth extractions & tooth pain).\n.\nIn my research, I wanted to know if the amount of lecture hours a dentist had while in school on addiction & safe prescribing influenced their opioid prescribing habits, relationships with patients and adherence to ethical practices. I sent out a survey to hundreds of Ohio dentists & was amazed by the results. \n.\nI won’t go into everything I found, BUT if you ever want to talk about this topic anytime, please feel free to reach out to me! #toothfulreviews",

A world where books are banned as a means for the government to control the thoughts of the public and keep them complacent. Imagine a world where firemen START fires, their hoses filled not with water, but kerosene.\nA fireman’s job is to burn all books, the houses that hide them & anyone who tries to protect them.\n.\nGuy Montag is a fireman in this dystopian world. He has become utterly aware of how empty and meaningless his life is so he turns to the books he’s ordered to burn in search of something deeper. Once a proud fireman, but now a “fireman turned sour” Montag struggles more and more each day to function in this escapist society. He longs for happiness, fulfillment & to understand whats wrong with society - so he turns to books. But no one who hides books is safe & no one can be trusted to keep the secret.\n.\nI love dystopian stories so much & this short classic by Bradbury is thought provoking, heart-breaking & quite honestly makes you appreciate your freedom to read books & have your own thoughts 💭🔥🚒 #mybookfeatures #toothfulreviews",

As the reader, we follow his NYC adventures. 🍎\n.\nFor the first 2/3 of the book, Holden drove me insane - he was indecisive, shallow & hypocritical. Although, there were times where I chuckled out loud, too, at Holden’s commentary - “I’m quite illiterate, but I read a lot.” After I finished the book, I went back through and read some different parts again & I began to understand the depth, emotion & struggle underlying [what I originally thought to be] superficialities of this story. A child trying to make it in an adult world that is very much disappointing, robbed of his childhood innocence earlier than is fair and trying to grow-up & move on in a world where he’s lost a brother who represented all that was genuine & true to him\n.\nOnce I stopped reading this book in one-dimension, I connected and empathized with Holden & his frustrations/resentments against “phony” people & things. I also feel that way a lot of the time, which is why I’ve learned to appreciate and hold-on to genuine people & things in my life 🧡\n.\nPS - I’m not in NYC right now 😔 this is a canvas I had printed of a picture I took on top of Rockefeller Center when I was last there! #toothfulreviews",

When I started, I actually thought there was a good chance I wouldn’t finish, but I am so glad I did & let me tell you...if you plan on reading this book, bring the whole dang tissue box for the last 2 chapters.\n.\nFrom the very beginning (really just from the title!) we know Vivek is dead. Grief pours from each of the characters — especially Vivek’s mother & father, who find him dead, left on their veranda, stripped of his clothes, and are in complete confusion how he died and who brought him back. Vivek’s mother suspects his closest friends, especially her nephew, Osita, are keeping secrets about Vivek’s mysterious death & vows to not rest until she learns the truth.\n.\nI don’t want to give too much of Vivek’s story away, but I want to convey the power this story radiates. I am having trouble finding the right words for this story. It is heartbreaking, yet freeing at the same time. This book is written non-chronologically & the point of view switches between third person narration & first person views from multiple characters. I found It to work perfectly with the telling of this story. \n.\nOverall, I was stunned & heart-broken. Right now, those are the only words I have for my first Emezi novel. I would absolutely read more by her. \n.\n⚠️: descriptive sexual scenes, incest, domestic violence, LGBTQ discriminating themes #toothfulreviews",

One night, her partying is interrupted by her father who calls her home with concerns about her cousin, Catalina, stemming from a disturbing letter she sent regarding her husband:\n.\n“He is trying to poison me. You must come for me Noemí. You have to save me.” \n.\nNoemí packs her bags & heads for an isolated mansion in the Mexican country to hopefully address these crazy allegations and get back to the city as soon as possible. But the rotting house & some of its inhabitants have other plans and are not keen upon letting either girl return.\n.\nLike I said, I did thoroughly enjoy this horror story, it just took ~200 pages to “build up” to the turning point where I had my “oh, sh*t” moment. I also couldn’t totally get behind some of the main plot points. Regardless, I think this book does tackle some interesting topics including Eugenics, Philosophy & Darwin’s evolution which I thoroughly enjoyed thinking about alongside this story. Also, 12 year-old Kristine, who wanted to be a mycologist (after reading Series of Unfortunate Events — The Grim Grotto & seeing it as a second best to Herbology) enjoyed all the information on fungi! 🍄\n.\nIf this book has been on your radar, read it. I binge read this on the car ride home from vacation & am still in a bit of a book-hangover from Circe. So, under different circumstances, I may have loved this book, because like I said, it’s interesting! And Moreno-Garcia writes a captivating story with vivid descriptions & chapter cliffhangers. I would love to hear other people’s thoughts on this book! 🌸 #toothfulreviews",

This also happened to be my first buddy read EVER with my very sweet friend @maryhadalittlenook ❤️ I loved being able to share my thoughts & feelings about this story with her while reading!!! \n.\nIn this story we follow Circe, the least favorite child of Helios, god of the Sun, as she pushes through hundreds of years being unappreciated & bullied by other gods & nymphs in her father’s halls, as she is exiled to the island of Aiaia for performing witchcraft, as she encounters familiar mythological monsters & individuals such as the Minotaur, Scylla & Charybdis, Medea & Jason, Hermes & of course, Odysseus. Circe has long felt that she doesn’t belong among the gods & titans, yet her immortality & divinity also keep her separated from mortals she loves. Through years of honing her witchcraft on her island of exile, Circe searches for where she truly belongs.\n.\nMadeline Miller makes a well-known story exciting and novel, while at the same time easily smoothing the way for a reader who has no knowledge of The Odyssey to enjoy ✨being able to read this story while on the beach only made It better! I absolutely cannot wait to read Song of Achilles and any other work she writes. 🧡\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #newtobookstagram #book #books #bookaddict #bookaholic #booksandbooks #Circe #readersofinstagram #readersofig #readers #madelinemiller #greekmythology #madelinemillercirce #bookworm #bookrecommendations #bookreview #bookshelf #bookstack #bibliophile #bibliophilelife #booknerd #booksofinstagram #bookreviews #bookreviewsandcoffee #toothfulreviews",

Mallard is a town so small it’s not recognized on any map. But, just like any small town, it has its rules — spoken & unspoken. A town that prides itself on making each generation of Negro lighter than the one before. At 16, however, the twins escape to New Orleans in search of a better more exciting life, wanting more to live for than Mallard can offer. Two twin sisters, 2 parts of 1 whole —  they could take on the world as long as they had each other. But things change. Stella unexpectedly leaves in the night & the two Vignes twins begin their separate lives. Desiree marries a darker man, one Mallard would never approve of & has a daughter that bears no resemblance to her. Stella secretly passes for a white woman and builds her entire life around this lie. She has a daughter as well, who grows up not knowing her true racial identity. What the twins could never imagine is that their daughters may be the key to weaving back together their separated lives. The only question is — is this what both twins want?\n.\n.\nI had high expectations going into this novel & I ended up reading it in a little over 24 hours. I was not disappointed in the slightest. This novel is powerful & courageous, raw & emotional. It tackles important topics including race, gender & class. The character development is impeccable. The effort Bennett put into each and every character’s story is impressive and clear. Overall, this multigenerational story will make you think and feel all the things.\n.\n.\nThis book is hyped up, and for good reason. It’s not every day you come across a deep meaningful story like this.

An ad in the newspaper seeking an apartment sitter brings Jules to the doorstep of one of Manhattans most historic and secretive buildings - The Bartholomew. \n.\nAfter an interview, Jules realizes she’s looking at $12,000 simply to live inside one of the recently vacant apartments until someone buys it. Not to mention it’s the exact same building that is the setting of her all time favorite book “Heart of a Dreamer”. Her best friend tries to tell her anything that seems too good to be true, probably is. But Jules needs the money...bad. Besides, there were only a few strict rules she had to follow & It was only temporary - she’d have enough money to hit the reset button in no time.\n.\nNo nights away from the apartment. No visitors & No bothering the guests who are rich or famous or both. This seems easy enough to Jules who desperately wants to start over. However, the Bartholomew’s shady history & the sudden disappearance of another apartment sitter, Ingrid, leave Jules wondering if she should investigate further or just keep her mouth shut and take the money.\n.\nAll the other residents of the Bartholomew are rich or famous. Why would they agree to allow poor, undignified “nobodies” without much family or friends take up residence there? Even if It is temporary. Unless, that’s the exact profile of a person they are looking for - someone that won’t be missed.\n.\nSager did not disappoint again & I really liked the twist this story took! 🚪👻\n.\n\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #newtobookstagram #book #books #bookaddict #bookaholic #booksandbooks #lockeverydoor #readersofinstagram #readersofig #readers #rileysager  #rileysagerbooks #bookworm #bookrecommendations #bookreview #bookshelf #bookstack #bibliophile #bibliophilelife #booknerd #booksofinstagram #bookreviews #toothfulreviews",

The stories don’t leave me feeling happy or satisfied—but that’s why I love them so much, I can’t stop thinking about them! (I know my boyfriend gets annoyed with me because I always  want to discuss them, but I just can’t help it, they fascinate me!) It’s so crazy how their plots can seem so outrageous & impossible, yet I can also rationalize how the world could come to be that way & how some parts of the world are already that way. (Can anyone spot Big Brother watching my stack of books? 😂)\n.\nToday, where change is essential for the world, books are a perfect source to turn to and educate yourself. There are so many resources at our disposal to continue  to try and understand & learn. I think the quote from Fran Lebowitz applies to the current racial injustice movement perfectly: “𝙏𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙠 𝙗𝙚𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙖𝙠. 𝙍𝙚𝙖𝙙 𝙗𝙚𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙠.”\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #newtobookstagram #read #bookstack #dystopia #dystopian #dystopianfiction #1984 #animalfarm #lordoftheflies #theroad #bravenewworld #aclockworkorange #bookworm #bookish #bookishcommunity",

Dickens & Great Expectations is no exception. The characters in this story are timeless & original, the plot is full of complexity and unexpected turns and the story left me with a lot of different feelings, mostly a hollow sadness as I wished the book had ended differently but at the same time loving the realism of it. \n_____________________________________________\nAt its core, this book is about someone who is given the chance to have all their dreams come true: to be elevated higher than they ever thought possible, to be taken seriously by those who never gave a second glance before, to be loved by someone of a higher status, and to have the money to spend on anything they desire. To have dreamed about all of these things coming true for so long & once having it, realizing how good he had it before. The lessons to be learned in this book are numerous. ————————————————————\nBeing so much more than a love story, Great Expectations is about loyalty and forgiveness, it shows the dangers of money and misperceptions & it is a story of self-discovery & letting go. This narrative will have me thinking for a very long time 👏🏼 4.5/5 ⭐️\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #newtobookstagram #read #booklover #greatexpectations #charlesdickens #bookporn #bookworm #readersofinstagram #bookart #classicnovels #pipandestella #bookish #toothfulreviews",

Frankenstein, however, forced me to acknowledge the fine line between scientific discovery and the dangers of “playing God.” It brought into the question the reality of human mortality and the basic human need for companionship & love which is, in a very real sense, like the necessities of hunger, thirst and shelter.\n.\nI found it particularly interesting to be reading this book at a time where the culture of the world is “accept and love everyone no matter their looks, sexual orientation, skin color, etc.” so my QOTD is this:\n\n𝙄𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮 𝙤𝙛 𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙠𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙞𝙣 𝙬𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙡 𝙩𝙤𝙙𝙖𝙮, 𝙙𝙤 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙠 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙗𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙢𝙚𝙩 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙖𝙗𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙝𝙖𝙩𝙧𝙚𝙙?

Nothing seems to be able to touch them, until a home-raid goes terribly wrong & Alex gets caught and sent to prison. In an effort to shorten his sentence, Alex opts for a new experimental treatment that claims to “cure” criminals. However, the controversy over this treatment is that it strips the receiver of choice between the good and the bad. For Alex, returning to society a “cured” man may actually mean becoming a helpless victim himself. ————————————————————\nAt first, I almost didn’t continue reading this book because it utilizes ’nadsat language’ a kind of Russian slang—I spent the first few chapters frustratingly looking up the meanings to words. But after awhile you start to learn what the words mean, and even come to like it.\n————————————————————\nI thought this book was going to be another dystopian novel all about violence, and while there is horrifying violence depicted, the book does not glorify violence nor do I think that is what the book is meant to be about. Rather, it explores the question of good & evil and what it means to be human. Is it better to choose to do bad than to be scientifically conditioned to be good, being stripped of having the ability to choose for yourself? ————————————————————\nI recommend you find the edition that includes the final chapter. But read the story first as if it didn’t include the final chapter. It is amazing how the outlook of the story changes when you experience both of these different “endings.” Overall, if you’re going to read A Clockwork Orange, pour yourself a glass of wine in advance, O my brothers.\n.\n#bookstagram #aclockworkorange #readersofinstagram #bookstagrammer #newtobookstagram #bookcommunity #readmorebooks #anthonyburgess #nadsat #dystopian",

At the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who has just arrived in the neighborhood, the eldest daughter, Jane, makes a fast connection. The second eldest daughter, Elizabeth, has quite the opposite connection with Mr. Bingley’s [even wealthier] friend, Mr. Darcy whom she believes to be vain, haughty and conceited. As the story unfolds, Elizabeth finds that oftentimes, first impressions aren’t what they seem. ⠀\n————————————————\nThis was my first experience reading anything by Jane Austen and I am absolutely enchanted by her. This book highlights how different the prospect of marriage was for women in the late 1700s-early 1800s and the importance of a woman having some wealth to be gained upon being married. Austen depicts well the entitlement of the wealthy and the “right” they felt they had to control the actions of lesser class individuals. There were many times my mouth hung open reading paragraphs of insults written in such elegant prose — Elizabeth always holds her own though, staying fiercely loyal to who she is, yet, humble enough to admit when she has made mistakes. ⠀\n————————————————\nOverall, this is a 5/5 stars for me! It took me a bit to get into it, but I was flying through the pages by the end. I cannot wait to read more by Austen! ⠀\n.⠀\n.⠀\n#bookstagram #bookstagrammer #newtobookstagram #mybookfeatures #bookcommunity #readmorebooks #bookrecommendations #avidreader #bookreaders #janeausten #prideandprejudice #janeites #bookporn #bookishfeatures #bookster #readinggoals #classicnovels #toothfulreviews",

Our people and our places.\n\nI’ve struggled to describe the writing of this book but the best I can come up is: disjointed but lyrical.

I think so.\n\nI didn’t like a single character; they were all one dimensional and honestly a bit bland.  Background of some characters could have been explored further to make for more compelling suspects and I would’ve liked more urgency and thrill from Alicia’s diary entries in the lead up to the crime and I think the entries themselves were written poorly.\n\nI will admit, the twist got me good BUT the ending was soooo disappointing!!\n\nI appreciate that Michaelides is a screen writer and that impacts his writing style, so can easily see this as an adaptation.",

Now I know that it seems like a lot of character’s points of views to keep track of but Gabaldon does a good job of making sure that they are not individual and in fact all line up together.  This really enriched the story and broke up the story (as it is a chunky one) and I liked hearing from Jamie and what he went through during and after the war.\n\n𝗩𝗼𝘆𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿 also takes us to a number of new locations including Boston and the West Indies but our Scottish hero is still at the heart of these stories.\n\nI know a lot of people (I’m looking 👀 at you @the.nook.of.books stopped with the series after this book but I’m soldiering on with the next.\n\nI should also share a disclaimer that I have watched the TV series, more than once 😏 (and if Josh asks it’s 100% for the story….) so nothing in the novels has come as a great shock or twist to me.  I felt the need to point this out as I have been asked how I have found the books compared to the show.",

Caught up in momentous events, each character reminds us of our power to survive extraordinary times, of the moral choices we make and the dramatic turns our lives can take.\n \nWhen this novel arrived in the post, I was so excited.  It looked like everything I love in a historical fiction story, a multi-generational family saga that was set in a time I’ve not read a lot about that has a strong focus on the female characters and their lives.\n\nWhile there were some elements that I enjoyed, such as the female aspect of this story and the focus on Adi’s wife and son, 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗽 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲 fell short for me.\n\nThis is a time in history that I do not know a lot about, and having studied some of The Russian Revolution and the affect it had on surrounding countries, I was looking forward to learning more.

Pls send help.\n\nAnyway, on with my #review!\n\nI will start with a disclaimer that I am already very much in love with James Alexander Malcolm Mackenzie Fraser and the way he says the word sassenach so this could very well be the biased review we’ve all seen coming...\n\nThe first in the now world famous series, thanks to @outlander_starz 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 follows our badass, swearing protagonist Claire Randall, a WW11 combat nurse as she finds herself transported to the 18th Century Scottish Highlands whilst on her second honeymoon with historian husband Frank.\n\nRelying on her brains, medical experience and knowledge of the future, Claire navigates her way a handful of near miss murder and sexual assault attempts and the realisation that she won’t be returning to 1947 any time soon.\n\nAccompanying her throughout is the aforementioned Jamie Fraser/McTavish/Red Jamie, who has his own fair share of near miss dramas following him as he tried to stay out of the hand of sadistic red coat, Black Jack Randall. Who just so happens to be Frank’s (yes, Claire’s Frank) six times great grandfather.\n\nI have ummed and ahhed about diving into reading this series since the show was first released and I’m very glad I decided on the audiobooks. They are very easy to dip in and out of, plus as is always the case, there’s a lot of details that are missed out in the show which I’ve personally found great to now know. \n\nMy only wish would be that it was narrated using both male and female voices to really get that Scottish accent through but asking @samheughan to narrate the books might be asking too much, ya ken?\n\nAlso, listening while at work when..ahem..thooooose scenes come on? 😳",

Deya’s only desire is to go to college and live a life different to that of her mother, Isra. \n\nForced into a marriage at the same age, Isra leaves her family in Palestine for her new life in America. Full of fresh hope that the land of the free will provide, Isra struggles with her oppressive mother-in-law and strange husband, Adam.\n\nDeya soon discovers the shocking truth of her family and struggles with the looming decisions she has to make.\n\n“𝙇𝙚𝙩 𝙢𝙚 𝙩𝙚𝙡𝙡 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜. 𝘼 𝙢𝙖𝙣 𝙞𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙤𝙣𝙡𝙮 𝙬𝙖𝙮 𝙪𝙥 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙, 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙝𝙚’𝙡𝙡 𝙘𝙡𝙞𝙢𝙗 𝙖 𝙬𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙣’𝙨 𝙗𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙩𝙤 𝙜𝙚𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚.“\n\n𝗔 𝗪𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗡𝗼 𝗠𝗮𝗻 explores how the ‘prison’ of domesticity is nearly impossible to escape for Arab women and focuses on what a woman’s life is worth. Daughter. Wife. Mother.\n\nIt’s very sad to read and honestly made me incredibly angry, the grandmother did my head in for a number of reasons - mostly because she was treating her daughter-in-laws AND daughter in the same horrible way that she had been treated. No attempt to do better than what she had was ever made. If she had to suffer, then so did they.\n\nI would recommend reading @caglareads review of this novel, it’s stuck with me ever since I read it and gave me a whole other view of this story. \n\nI obviously can’t comment on how close to the truth this novel takes, or bends in order to build the narrative but I’m intrigued to read more about the life of Arab women and there lives, and for me the best thing a book can do is make me think and want to know more.",

As the hours tick by, the girls know the chance of Yin being found alive is becoming smaller and smaller.\n\nEveryone is affected by Yin’s disappearance—even scholarship student Chloe, who usually stays out of Balmoral dramas, is drawn into the maelstrom.

She was so lovely and welcoming and listening to the story behind the story made my reading experience quite unique I think.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗮𝗽𝘀 is more than a YA novel. It’s more than it’s genre. It’s about women. Young women. It’s about race and power and privilege.\n\nHonestly, having moved to a large city (the population of Melbourne is the same as the entire population of New Zealand...) has made me question my safety, especially at night time and using public transport. Obviously what’s been in the media lately has highlight the issue of women’s safety again.

Ivy is a philanthropist with a troubled past, distracted by the snoring man beside her. Summer is a young theatre usher, anxious about the safety of her girlfriend in the fire zone.\n\nThis is not something I would have usually picked up, but thanks to @tandemcollectiveglobal and @hachetteaus I got to!\n\nI normally find this style of writing and the lack of quotation makes really difficult to get my head around but in 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲, everything just...flowed.\n\nThe internal monologue of these three women was perhaps my favourite thing about this novel. At times, I was so emerged in their minds and thoughts, you’d forgive me for forgetting that there was a play in act at all. But then Winnie and Willie bound their way back in.  I’m also very glad that I didn’t feel overwhelmed or required to know Beckett while reading.\n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 is one of those novels that could be seen as pretentious (it’s very character driven) but I found it warm and engaging.

I don’t think I’ve left a book of her’s without a tear in my eye.\n\n𝗡𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗥𝗼𝗮𝗱 was a good read, and just what I felt like but unfortunately something fell a little flat for me and I think it was because I found it...predictable? I’d figured out a few of the heartbreaking aspects that were coming pretty quickly and while knowing didn’t take away from the reading experience, I personally could’ve done with a few less hints at what was going to happen.\n\nI enjoyed Lexi and Eva as characters but omfg Jude 🤬 did my bloody head in. Every time the novel focused on her, I just wanted to scream and shake her. What a woman. If I was a teenager again and had that kind of mother 😖 I think this is the point though, to show us what length parents do go to? I mean, ultimately this is a novel about parents and the love they have for their children.\n\nOverall a good read, and KH definitely remains one of my favourite authors!",

Trevor’s comedic nature makes this very readable (and for easy listening) considering the information and facts that are given.

I can definitely see why this is considered essential reading and would highly recommend it!\n\n𝙅𝙤𝙨𝙝: This was really funny and interesting and I honestly laughed out lot often. I enjoyed all the facts about the different tribes and life during apartheid. Listening to the audio book with Trevor as the narrator was good and his mother seems like a bad-ass!",

Temperatures rise when the first passenger is shot, and Hercule Poirot must abandon the mysteries of ancient Egypt and focus on altogether deadlier matters...\n\n“𝙄’𝙙 𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙥𝙪𝙩 𝙢𝙮 𝙙𝙚𝙖𝙧 𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙥𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙡 𝙖𝙜𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙩 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙙 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙟𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙥𝙪𝙡𝙡 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙜𝙜𝙚𝙧.“\n\nThis was my first ever Christie novel and it’s easily one of her most famous works. I’ve always put off reading anything by this author as I’ve found them quite daunting and up until late last year, didn’t even enjoy crime novels.\n\nThere are a lot of characters to be introduced to at the beginning and at first I struggled with remembering how everyone was connected. But once the premise was set, I found 𝗗𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗡𝗶𝗹𝗲 to be most intriguing. \n\nI think it’s important to remember that this novel was first published in 1937, so the language and writing techniques used are very different to what we are used to in modern novels. In saying that, it didn’t feel like I was reading and old book! It felt fresh and interesting and I couldn’t wait to get to reading.\n\nThe plot is very neat and descriptive but still leaves the reader questioning whodunnit in subtle ways.\n\nI’m so glad I picked this one up and will definitely be reading more Christie! Also cannot wait to see the new film adaptation and watch these characters come to life!",

New requirements were announced 13 hours before we were due to fly which resulted in a rushed effort to prove negative Covid tests ($500 later thank you very much) and an extended stay in Auckland which we were not planning on.\n\nBut we have managed to make the most of the 2020 that was (or wasn’t).\nWe got use to living with each other full time, thanks lockdown 😉 we made plans for our future and continued to look forward to the day when we could finally go on our Trans-Tasman adventure.\n\nI’m honestly not going to believe it’s happening until that plane touches down in Tullamarine 🛬 but I’ve got the essentials packed as you can see.\n\nI started reading 𝗕𝗼𝗿𝗻 𝗮 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲 last week but then I thought listening to the audio book along side it would be a bloody brilliant idea.

This story explores autism and neuro a typicality as well as fertility issues.\n\nFern and Rose’s individual chapters work together really well and Rose’s in particular add to the suspense of this domestic thriller (I don’t know 100% if that’s the genre it falls under, but that’s what it felt like to me 🤷🏻‍♀️). Rose’s insight to their upbringing definitely creates mystery.\n\nI really enjoyed that this was character driven and I loved that the library was such a huge setting for this book, I thought Wally was all the heart eyes 😍 and from one Fern to another, was reminded to believe in myself.\n\nHave you read this one?!",

What’s more, her perfect relationship with her long-term boyfriend is the envy of all their friends.\n\nBut Tori isn’t being honest.\n\nWhile everyone around her is getting engaged and having babies, Tori’s boyfriend will barley look at her, let alone talk about marriage. And when her best friend Dee unexpectedly falls in love, Tori’s in danger of being left behind. \n\nTori’s built a career of living her best life, but is she brave enough to admit it’s not what she wants?\n\n“𝙏𝙪𝙧𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙧𝙩𝙮 𝙞𝙨 𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙥𝙡𝙖𝙮𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙢𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙡 𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙞𝙧𝙨.

About being in your late twenties/early thirties, about your friends moving on while you’re left behind. \n\nI loved it because it felt so real.\n\nI also hated it because it felt so real.\n\nThere was so much to enjoy. References to the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, multiple attempts to get that perfect coffee snap for social media, that little pouch on your stomach affectionately called Herman.\n\nI expected to hate Tori, and maybe a teeny bit of me did, but I also felt really sorry for her? Like, we’ve all mostly been there right? Who hasn’t been jealous of a friend, had a partner we wished we’d broken up with sooner than we did? If anything I was reminded, we are not perfect, we don’t need to be.\n\nA fab novel. I’m so glad that I picked this one up!

Ania is imprisoned and forced to endure the atrocities of a Nazi concentration camp. Danuta’s search for her sister leads her into the dangers of the Polish Underground.\n\nEach will do what they just to survive long enough to find each other. Their dream of being reunited is crushed in shocking circumstances.\n\nIn an astonishing twist of fate, the opportunity for revenge presents itself 60 years later. But faced with the ultimate decision what will be the outcome...seek justice or revenge.\n\nWow. What an emotional and brutal read. I don’t think I’ve come across a novel so incredibly well researched before. You’d be forgiven for forgetting that 𝗛𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲𝗿’𝘀 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗹 is indeed fiction. Despite the harrowing and heartbreaking scenes, I could not put it down.\n\nAs a massive history buff, I personally found the intricate details compelling and necessary to achieve what makes this novel so great. Without them, it would be just another story of the Nazi occupation. \n\nI’ve not read much on the Polish Underground and I found that fascinating.  I think a lot of people tend to forget that it wasn’t just Germany that was affected, but Poland and the majority of Eastern Europe also.\n\nI think what I liked most about this story, is the multiple narratives. You get a look inside the characters, from prisoner, Nazi, resistance.\n\nI highly recommend this novel if you’re wanting something intense and richly paced. And please, do read the author notes at the end for an insight into why he wrote this book and the research he undertook - including visits to the concentration camps.\n\nA huge thank you to the author @stevematthewsauthor for the opportunity to read and review.",

But Dr Pinecroft has plans for a revolutionary experiment- convinced that sea air will prove to be the cure his wife and children needed, he arranges to house a group of prisoners suffering from the same disease in the cliffs beneath his new Cornish home. \n\nForty years later, Hester Why arrives at Morvoren House to take up a position as nurse to the now partially paralysed and almost entirely mute Miss Pinecroft.

Various characters within the novel seem to be haunted by the past and driven by duty, guilt and fear.\n\nI found interesting parallels between Hester and Louise, strengthened by the alternative narrative of past and present. Their attempts to determine what is “real” and if fairies do really exist being the main one.\n\nThere’s a strong sense of old-time beliefs throughout that add the gothic, creepy nature to this novel - it was truely menacing.\n\nI am definitely adding Laura Purcell’s backlist to my pile.",

She returns home from honeymoon with her new husband wrapped around her little finger.\n⁣\nBut then everything changes. Thomas’s behaviour becomes volatile and violent. He stays out all night, returning home bloodied and full of secrets.\n⁣\nWhen the first woman is murdered in Whitechapel, Susannah’s interest of piqued. But as she follows the reports of the ongoing hunt for the killer, her mind takes her down the darkest path imaginable....is it coincidence? Or is her husband the man they call Jack the Ripper?\n⁣\n𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗯𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿 is a dark, tense and atmospheric novel with extremely flawed characters - I don’t think there was a single one that I remotely liked. While Susannah is someone I found irritating, I also strongly admired her inquisitive nature and that she was determined to make a life for herself.\n⁣\nThere’s a very large focus on what it means to be a woman with little future, other than marrying for convenience, and suffering through endless abuse as a result. But it’s not only the married women who suffer, of course there are the whores and maids of London who fall victim to the murderous man. \n⁣\nWhile the first part was very slow (for me) it picked up in the second half and I genuinely wasn’t bored by any small detail, it is very descriptive.\n⁣\nThis is an excellent debut, that I really enjoyed and think if you enjoy tense mysteries, especially if they’re historical or gothic, you’ll really like this one! My only “warning” is that some might find it too graphic.\n⁣\nA huge thank you to @harpercollinsnz and @headofzeus for my advanced reading proof ✨ \n⁣\n#gifted #ad",

While her gorgeous brother is a sports hero, her father longs to return home and her mother is desperate to hold this family of four together. When Gifty's brother's glorious success on the basketball court falters, addiction strikes and the mother turns inward, and to religion, to find a cure. Each one of the characters tries to find a way to heal the heartbreak- for the mother it is God, for Gifty's father it is escape and for Gifty, our narrator - it is science. \n⁣\nWhat I want to say first is this: I’ve seen a LOT of reviews on this book comparing it to Gyasi’s debut 𝗛𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 (which I myself gave 5 stars ✨) but it’s important to remember that this is a completely different novel, with different characters and themes. Obviously the focus on race is prominent - but my advice is go into 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗞𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗱𝗼𝗺 with an open mind or even blind. \n⁣\nThis book is sad and heartbreaking and frustrating.

Her London colleagues find her distant and mysterious, her cool beauty the topic of conversations around its quiet halls. No one could imagine that she is a desperately damaged woman, hiding her trauma behind her chic, French image.\n⁣\nIt is only when some dramatic Byzantine pearls are loaned to the Museum that Severine's poise is dashed and the tightly controlled life she's built around herself is shattered.

This can be hit or miss due to feeling like you can’t fully connect with the characters but I felt this style was important for the premise of this story.\n⁣\nThere are strong themes of race and religion - focusing on what it means to live in America and be American. I felt that Nora and Coleman were the standout characters, but would have liked to read more from Salma’s point of view. \n⁣\nSlow in some parts, it did pick up in the second half. The character backgrounds are somewhat predictable and stereotypical but over all, a timely and well written novel that I’m very glad to have found.",

That isn’t to say that this novel isn’t full of important themes! \n⁣\nIt’s a book full of books, a book about a book lover, for book lovers!\n⁣\nI personally loved reading about Melbourne, which was suppose to become my new home (fingers crossed🤞🏻 this happens next year, we’ve been so excited watching the city open up) and all that the city has to offer. It genuinely feels like a love letter to Melbourne. The amount of times I told my other half “ooooh there’s a bit in this book about Brunswick! Oooh remind me to write down the name of this shop!” 😂\n⁣\nBea is a hot mess, and I’m sure most of us can relate to that. \n⁣\nRelatable, funny and heart warming, this was a fab read! 💕",

All Gillian and Sally ever wanted was to get away.\n \nAnd eventually they do - one marries, the other runs as far from home as she can manage.\n \nYears later, however, tragedy will bring the sisters back together. And they'll find that no matter what else may happen, they'll always have each other.\n⁣\nI was recently #gifted the much anticipated new release 𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻𝘀 and didn’t realise it was the prequel to both 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗰 and 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗰.\n⁣\nI felt I needed to read both the first two before diving in, so spent Halloween night with this beloved classic!\n⁣\n“𝙉𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝘿𝙖𝙮...𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙤𝙤𝙣 𝙞𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙬𝙖𝙮𝙨 𝙟𝙚𝙖𝙡𝙤𝙪𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙩 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙙𝙖𝙮, 𝙟𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙖𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙪𝙣 𝙖𝙡𝙬𝙖𝙮𝙨 𝙡𝙤𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙙𝙖𝙧𝙠 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙙𝙚𝙚𝙥.“\n⁣\nSally and Gillian are as different as characters can be. But their bond is strong and they are bound for life. What I loved about this story, was that despite the synopsis, it’s not just about Sally and Gillian. It’s about Antonia and Kylie, and all the people that surround them. \n⁣\nThere is just enough information given about the Owens women that have come before them and it’s made me so keen to read the next two novels!",

Removed from school and sold as a third wife, the unspeakable happened when she is secretly sold as a domestic segment to a household in the wealthy enclaves of Lagos.\n⁣\nAdunni is repeatedly told that she is nothing. But Adunni won’t be silenced. She is determined to find her voice - in a whisper, in song, in broken English - until she can speak for herself, for the girls who came before, and did all the girls who will follow.\n⁣\nOh Adunni.  How my heart broke for her over and over again while reading.  At times, it was hard to remember that we start this novel with a fourteen-year-old and follow through her hardships.  Fourteen.  I cannot imagine ever having to live a life like this, let alone being married off as a third wife at that age and then into a life of slavery.\n \n“𝙒𝙝𝙮 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙣 𝙞𝙣 𝙉𝙞𝙜𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙖 𝙨𝙚𝙚𝙢 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙚 𝙨𝙪𝙛𝙛𝙚𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙢𝙤𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙢𝙚𝙣?“\n \nAll the while, through each event after the next, Adunni refuses to give up on learning and having a louding voice.\n \nThe broken English in which this novel is written adds a layer of authenticity and I really felt as if I was listening to Adunni’s “voice” while reading.  𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗶𝗿𝗹 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗟𝗼𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗩𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲 combines an unforgettable protagonist with a plight so familiar in literature – but in a way that is unique to itself and its geography.\n \nIn some ways it reminded me of a Cinderella story but instead of trying to find her Prince Charming, Adunni is searching for her voice and her education.\n⁣\nA moving novel that celebrates girls and their dreams.\n⁣\n@abidare_author I must know that Adunni got her happy ending!",

She moves her young son to Essex where rumours reach them from further up the estuary that the mythical Essex Serpent, once said to roam the marshes claiming human lives, has returned to the coastal parish of Aldwinter. \n⁣\nCora, a keen amateur naturalist with no patience for religion or superstition, is immediately enthralled, convinced that what the local people think is a magical beast may be a previously undiscovered species. \n⁣\nPersonally, while I love the idea of the plot and Cora as a character, 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘅 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘁 felt never ending.

A heartbreakingly poetic and haunting story about consent, about who has the space to speak and who is believed.\n⁣\nTwenty-one-year-old Olivia has synaesthesia, which means that she hears sounds and feels emotions in colour - but her life is mottled grey. Estranged from her parents and living with her grandfather who is drowning in sadness, Oli faces the reality of life beyond university alone.\n⁣\nWhen she wakes on a boat with no recollection of how she got there, she accepts the help of two strangers who change the course of her future forever.

Maud is a lonely child growing up without a mother, ruled by her repressive father. When he finds a painted medieval devil in a graveyard, unhallowed forces are awakened. Maud's battle has begun. She must survive a world haunted by witchcraft, the age-old legends of her beloved fen - and the even more nightmarish demons of her father's past. \n⁣\nSpanning five centuries, Wakenhyrst is a darkly gothic thriller about murderous obsession and one girl's longing to fly free..\n⁣\nFrom the start I found this book really intriguing.  The Suffolk Fens provide a brooding backdrop to the story, with hints of the supernatural.\n \nWhile much of the novel is set in the Edwardian era, the tale of female oppression is timely, and I thought it could’ve easily been set 200 year prior.\n \nI found Maud to be an unlikely feminist heroine who, while she had her own dark secrets, I was rooting for her the entire story. \n⁣\nHer father’s behaviour and attitude towards women was appalling, he was suppressive and controlling and I wanting to scream when reading his journal entries.  \n \nPaver has wonderfully researched this era and setting to create a magnificent piece of fiction.\n \nI only have one bone to pick, and without giving too much away – I just want to know more about THAT twist.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this gothic novel!\n\nThanks to @thebookcovetersbookclub for picking this one! 💫",

For this vacation, they've chosen an idyllic and isolated estate in the Scottish Highlands--the perfect place to get away and unwind by themselves. They arrive on December 30th, just before a historic blizzard seals the lodge off from the outside world. But after a decade, the weight of secret resentments has grown too heavy for the group's tenuous nostalgia to bear. Amid the boisterous revelry of New Year's Eve, the cord holding them together snaps. On New Year's Day, one of them is dead, and another of them did it.\n⁣\n“𝙏𝙝𝙖𝙩’𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙤𝙡𝙙 𝙛𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙙𝙨.

Now she saw there was something more complex to it all - something darker.\n⁣\nRebecca Wood arrives in Shipwreck Bay, ready for a quiet life as the new post mistress of this sleepy seaside town. Fleeing a scandal and haunted by her past, Rebecca is determined to make different choices.\n⁣\n“𝙈𝙮𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙦𝙪𝙚 𝙞𝙣 𝙖 𝙬𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙣 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙤 𝙢𝙚𝙣 𝙗𝙪𝙩 𝙞𝙩 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙙𝙤𝙜𝙨 𝙞𝙛 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙙 𝙞𝙩 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 𝙬𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙣.

But life comes with expectations, there are choices to be made, boxes to tick and sometimes - stereotypes to fulfil. And when her best friends’ lives start to branch away towards marriage and motherhood, leaving the path they’ve always followed together, Olive starts to question her choices - because life according to Olive looks a little bit different. \n⁣\nI think this is going to be a book that you either love or hate because the topics are really confronting.\n⁣\nPersonally, I loved it. I think there are some really important themes discussed in OLIVE, in a relatable way.\n⁣\n“𝘽𝙚𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙜 𝙞𝙨 𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙡𝙮 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙛𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙜.

She starts to deal with expectations and reactions when she begins telling those close to her of her choice NOT to have children...\n⁣\n“𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙞𝙙𝙚𝙖 𝙤𝙛 𝙗𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖 𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙨𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙥𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙙𝙤𝙬𝙣 𝙩𝙤 𝙢𝙚 - 𝙛𝙧𝙤𝙢 𝙢𝙮 𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧’𝙨 𝙢𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧, 𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙘𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙘𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙨𝙤𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜.

While the book explored sexuality and how women in 50’s Hollywood felt they had to use their bodies to succeed, the last third of Evelyn’s life felt really rushed.

As the execution draws closer, Agnes’s ill-fated tale of longing and betrayal begins to emerge. And with it the family’s terrible realisation that all is not as they assumed.\n⁣\nBased on a true story, 𝗕𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗶𝘁𝗲𝘀 is a deeply moving novel about personal freedom and the ways in which we will risk everything for love.\n⁣\nThe perfect story to read during a cold and wild weekend, I devoured it! The Icelandic setting sounded ragged and magical. ❄️ The fact that Agnes was a real person and the last women executed in Iceland made it all the more moving.\n⁣\nI absolutely loved the prose in which this was written and cannot wait to read @hannahkentwrites 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲! \n⁣\n“𝙄 𝙖𝙢 𝙙𝙚𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙤 𝙘𝙡𝙤𝙨𝙚 𝙢𝙮𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙡𝙙, 𝙩𝙤 𝙩𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙚𝙣 𝙢𝙮 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙝𝙤𝙡𝙙 𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙤 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙝𝙖𝙨 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙮𝙚𝙩 𝙗𝙚𝙚𝙣 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙡𝙚𝙣 𝙛𝙧𝙤𝙢 𝙢𝙚.

Five siblings struggle to stay together as the tides of war threaten to tear them apart.\n⁣\nWhen Germany invades and occupies France in the Second World War, the five Laskowski children lose everything: their home, their Jewish community and most devastatingly their parents who are abducted in the night. \n⁣\nThere is no safe place left for them to evade the Nazis, but they cling together, never certain when the authorities will come for what is left of them.\n⁣\nInspired by the poignant, true story of the author’s mother, this moving historical novel conveys the hardship, the uncertainty and the impossible choices the Laskowski children were forced to make to survive the horrors of the Holocaust.\n⁣\nThere isn’t much I could put down in words about this book. Written with lyrical prose and such pounding emotion 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘂𝗿𝘃𝗶𝘃𝗼𝗿𝘀 is a truely heartbreaking story.

Their stories cross continents – from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland – as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.\n⠀⠀\nBecause this story is based on real people and events, it makes it even more harrowing. I found 𝗟𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗰 𝗚𝗶𝗿𝗹𝘀 well researched and wonderfully written, entwining three lives together in a haunting and beautiful way. I read this first a couple of years ago and I still think about it today. Lovers of historical fiction, give this one a go!\n⠀⠀\nI’ve also read the prequel 𝗟𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗥𝗼𝘀𝗲𝘀 and enjoyed it too!",

𝗖𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗲𝘀 is beautifully tragic and immensely heartbreaking to read.\n⠀⠀\nThe story follows Johannes, an avid member of the Hitler Youth. As the war rages on, he discovers his parents are hiding a Jewish girl called Elsa behind a false wall in their large house in Vienna. His initial horror turns to love and obsession.\n⠀⠀\nBoth manipulating and manipulated, Johannes soon finds he is the only one aware of Elsa’s existence in the house the only one responsible for her survival.\n⠀⠀\nAs a lover of historical fiction, and having read many novels from this time period, it was different for me to read from this character point of view. ⠀⠀\nMy heart truely ached while reading and the possessive and thrilling nature of the novel really surprised me!!",

Adopted as a baby after his sixteen year old mother is cast out from home, Cyril is more of a curiosity for his adoptive parents than a son. He meets Julian Woodbead and his whole world changes.\n⠀⠀\nWow! I was instantly engrossed within this story. Outraged, moved and astounded. I fell for Cyril’s character, his innocence seemed so endearing and his emotions were constantly conflicted throughout.\n⠀⠀\nI don’t want to spoil this for anyone at all but it was laugh out loud funny, heartbreaking and John Boyne dealt with so many stereotypes within 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁’𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗙𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 from homosexuality, the AIDS/HIV pandemic of the 1980’s/90’s to the Catholic Church and the response to pre-martial childbearing.\n⠀⠀\nI highly recommend this novel.

I was hooked and at the same time wanting to put it away and never open it again.\n⠀⠀\nVanessa was beyond irritating as a character, but I have an inkling that’s intentional? I just wanted to shake her and scream for her to see sense! There is manipulation from Strane from the outset, by making Vanessa believe that it was all her idea, that she started the relationship.\n⠀⠀\n“...𝑏𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑚𝑒 𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡, 𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑚𝑒 𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑡𝑜𝑔𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑎𝑠 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑛𝑒𝑤.“\n⠀⠀\nAs a woman, I wanted and expected more from her character - but that’s a point of MDV right? She doesn’t think anything they did was wrong.\n⠀⠀\nIn the end, I found it to be a lot of build up and background for a kinda predictable ending...? It fell flat for me.\n⠀⠀\nThis is obviously a really tough subject matter to address and I think Russell has done a great job of bringing it to light. The fact that her writing made me physically feel while reading, is in itself wonderful.",

Edith and her sister Magda survive unimaginable circumstances not only at Auschwitz, but in their post-liberation lives as well.\n⠀⠀\nI felt so moved reading this, and the choices she made to learn and astoundingly forgive what happened to her and her family.

Lale was given the job of tattooing the prisoners marked for survival - scratching numbers into his fellow victim’s arms to create what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust.\n⠀⠀\nLale was determined to survive but he was determined to save the girl he meets waiting in line to be tattooed as well. So begins the love story of the Tattooist of Auschwitz.\n⠀⠀\nI’m aware that many who’ve reviewed this have pointed out the number of historical inaccuracies within this story and found it too much like an academic retelling, but I want to stick to what made this book 4 stars for me.\n⠀⠀\nMorris did a lot of research while writing, meeting Lale and his family. For me, she created something extraordinary and incredibly touching out of Lale’s story and if a book can stay with me and still have me thinking about it two years later, I think that is magical in itself. It also made me want to research further which I think is a bonus!\n⠀⠀\nI should point out, I did study The Holocaust significantly so it is a topic that instantly appeals to me so I could be slightly bias within this review.",

It’s his five-year-old daughter, Izzy. He never sees her again. \nThree years later, Gabe spends his days and nights traveling up and down the highway, searching for the car that took his daughter, refusing to give up hope, even though most people believe she’s dead. “Throughout the year, it seemed, there were events designed to remind the lonely that they were indeed lonely.” Fran and her daughter, Alice, also put in a lot of miles on the road. Not searching. Running. Because Fran knows what really happened to Gabe’s daughter. She knows who is responsible. And she knows what they will do if they ever catch up to her and Alice.\n\nThriller and horror/supernatural novels are NOT my cup of tea. I find myself thinking “WTF?!” throughout the first quarter of The Other People. Initially confused by how all the characters were intertwined with each other (though I think this is perhaps intentional?), the connecting elements started to come together.\nI think I guessed one or two of the twists earlier on, again this could be intentional.\n\nThe Other People is really well written, I can definitely see why the author has been compared to Stephen King, and while I didn’t love this novel - I couldn’t put it down because I just had to know what happened!! I could see this being adapted into one of those British crime drama mini-series (which oddly enough, I really like watching..?).",

His life in the public eye allowed him a privileged position which few experienced, with access to select places and an army of adoring fans. Several decades later, Jack receives a phone call from his secretary. The urgency in her voice stops him in his tracks. A story about Jack has emerged on social media and gone viral. It details his relationship with a young woman, Marian Davies, thirty years previously. The last thing Jack needs is scandal, especially when he's about to embark on an important new career move. As he looks back over the decades since he last saw Marian, to a time before social media when he controlled the narrative, one question remains: why has Marian reappeared?\n•\n•\n•\nI don’t have much to say about this book other than I REALLY wanted to enjoy it but I found Letters to the Editor quite dull and old fashioned. It was slow, and extremely character driven throughout. I kinda just wanted it to be over 🤷🏻‍♀️ which is absolutely not what I look for in a book. •\n•\n•\n#bookreview #netgalley #bookstagram #readersofinstagram #booksconnectus #readmorebooks #loverofbooks #bibliophile #bookaddict #bookclub #bookcommunity #bookfeature #bookgram #bookishfeature #bookishlove #booklover #booknerd #bookstagramfeature #booksofig #bookstagrammer #igreads",

When her mother dies, Naomi’s emotional struggle is exacerbated by her attempts to appease her father’s demands for self-restraint and composure.\n•\n•\n•\nWith her father increasing turning to the bottle for solace, Naomi seeks attention elsewhere, devising highly embellished tales to shock her classmates and delight in their reaction. But one tale goes too far and Naomi’s life begins to unravel...\n•\n•\n•\nNaomi Rose navigates the life of a troubled teenager well. Losing her mum at a young age, sets the scene for her ongoing actions and behaviour.\n•\n•\n•\nThe novel jumps from present day, adult Naomi, to ten year-old, to teenager. Adult Naomi questioning if “there is a cut-off point when grief becomes an excuse rather than a justification.” I enjoyed this real, it reminded me of teenage life - the ups and the downs of navigating our way through. It was a short novel (I finished it in a day) and I honestly didn’t know who the ‘Gardner’ was until the last page! An outstanding debut from @kirstenesden “Life does not happen to us.

Her father is an SS officer, her brother in the Hitler Youth, training to become a fighter pilot, herself a member of the BDM. She believes resolutely in her country, and the man who runs it.\n•\n•\n•\nUntil Walter changes everything. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed Walter. The boy who saved her life. A Jew.\nAs Hetty falls deeply in love with a man who is everything she’s been taught to hate, she will have to risk everything to save him, even if it means sacrificing herself.\n•\n•\n•\nWow. My heart ached after reading this. From the outset you understand that, probably like so many children of the Reich, Hetty doesn’t fully comprehend what is going on in the world around her - or why. There is a vague innocence about it all. That the physical traits between an Ayran child and a Jewish child are difficult to tell. But soon Hetty starts to discover that Walter “oozes otherness”, that looks are deceiving, blood and breeding never lie. \nShe decides that Walter is worth the risk. •\n•\n•\nThere are themes are sexuality throughout, the different social expectations of genders. Why can a boy do this, but a girl can’t? •\n•\n•\nThe author has done an amazing job of describing that not all Germans agreed with the racial hatred regime forced upon them. Hetty begins to learn of the hardships and restrictions placed on Jewish people. Her mind alters and her love for Walter grows. She starts to stand up for her own beliefs, while hiding a number of secrets too.\n•\n•\n•\nStories from this time are rarely written from the “Nazi” point of view, it was heartbreakingly refreshing.\n•\n•\n•\n“There are two sides, or more perhaps, to every thought. Every action. We only ever want to see one.”\n•\n•\n@bookreviewfeatures \n#bookreview #peoplelikeus #daughterofthereich #netgalley #headofzeus #historicalfiction #bookstagram #readersofinstagram #booksconnectus #readmorebooks #loverofbooks #bibliophile #bookaddict #bookclub #bookcommunity #bookfeature #bookgram #bookishfeature #bookishlove #booklover #bookstagramfeature #booksofig #bookstagrammer #igreads #goodreads #prettybooks #bookwormsunite  #morebookslessalgorithm",

From the day that old Nana Reja found a baby abandoned, in a blanket covering of bees, little Simonopio is for some locals the stuff of superstition, a child kissed by the devil. He becomes a cause of wonder for his adopted family. Followed by his protective swarm of bees and living to deliver his adopted family from threats, Simonopio’s purpose in time. Will be divined.\n.\n.\nThis story is well crafted, with gorgeous prose and a storyline that flows beautifully.  The Murmur of Bees 🐝 is easily one of the most outstanding stories I’ve ever read, you can almost feel and hear the hum of the bees as you read.  I encourage you - if you have not already - to read this masterpiece! .\n.\n“Life waits for no one.”\n.\n. \n#bookreview #themurmurofbees #bookrecommendation #bookstagram #readersofinstagram #booksconnectus #readmorebooks #loverofbooks #bibliophile #bookaddict #bookclub #bookcommunity #bookfeature #bookgram #bookishfeature #bookishlove #booklover #booknerd #bookstagramfeature #booksofig #bookstagrammer #igreads #goodreads #prettybooks #bookwormsunite #mexicannovel #fivestarreview",

Meaning, quite simply, from that moment on, their destinies were sealed.”\n - The Maidens \n\nThis is slow-burn goodness. I loved the examination on grief, the Greek references, the Tennyson poetry, and the nod to THE SILENT PATIENT. \nThe opening pages introduce us to Mariana, a 36-year old therapist, who is still mourning the loss of her husband a year earlier. \nAfter a group session one evening, she receives a fevered call from her niece Zoe, at college in Cambridge. A young woman’s body has been found, and Zoe can’t locate her best friend Tara. \nTo Cambridge Mariana goes. \nZoe discloses something alarming about professor Edward Fosca and Mariana is determined to see her nieces fears investigated. When no one takes her seriously, she decides to investigate on her own.\n\nI saw the twist coming but it was still delicious. I absolutely loved the descriptions of Cambridge, and of Greece. There were some tangents I struggled to find relevance in but that’s probably a me issue. Overall I really enjoyed this. \n,\n.\nThank you so much to {partner} @celadonbooks for my copy! \n.\n.\n#themaidens #alexmichaelides #celadonbooks #bookstagram #thriller #darkacademia #coffeeandbooks #beautifulbooks #2021books #igreads #bookishhygge #bookaesthetic #reading #bookphotography #bookflatlay #bookblogger #instadaily #instamood #picoftheday",

So I picked up WITH TEETH by @kristen__arnett . I’m about a third of the way in and I’m feeling for Sammie. It’s one thing to not be able to bond with your child (I feel like we need to normalize that and encourage seeking help rather than the proverbial “stoning”), but to have a child that won’t bond with you is probably tough. Thus far she really tries. Her wife Monika seems to be losing patience with the situation, but is absent enough to really not see the whole picture and be able to empathize with her wife. And that’s my other beef, women /men who are the full-time caretakers of the family children should be listened to, not brushed off or vilified. \nAll of that being said, this book is so good! I am really looking forward to where it goes. Samson is definitely …. unlikable, I know, he’s a kid, I shouldn’t say that, but he’s a bit diabolical. I keep thinking about that movie “The Bad Seed” while I’m reading 👀. \n.\n.\nAlso, let’s hear it for #lbgt representation in fiction 🌈🙌🏼. \n.\n.\n.\nGive me your #lbgtq book recommendations! 🌈🌈\n.\n.\n.\n#WithTeeth #lbgtqpride #pridemonth #mustread #lbgtfiction #literaryfiction #bookphotography #cozy #booksandcoffee #reading #amreading #pourover #coffeetime #bookaddict #bookobsessed #booktography #readingtime #potd #instamood",

I couldn’t put it down, and I loved the author’s writing style. \n\nMary was frumpy and not in the least bit cool back in high school. But she works hard in school and gets accepted into Cornell, prompting the local paper in her small town to write an article about her entitled, “Ivy League Mary”. Only then do get classmates take notice of her. And then she’s off, out of her small town, to bigger things. \n\nHer junior year, everything changes for her in the blink of an eye when she’s expelled from Cornell. She goes home, humiliated, gets a job at a local grocer, a failure. \n\nWhen a local girl goes missing, it’s a big deal. This isn’t just any girl, Olivia Willard is a rising influencer and a former friend of Mary’s. Mary can’t help but connect the dots to another missing girl from their town, DeMaria Jackson. \nNo one believes her or even gives credence to her ideas. It’s made clear that these are two very different types of girls. Or are they…..?\n\nI found highlighting the way people from different backgrounds and socioeconomic strata are treated by the public and the police to be important and ambitious. \n*(In my own town there are two cases that display this. See: Heidi Seeman and Erica Botello, San Antonio Tx.)*\n\nAlso interesting was the notion that when you get down to it, sometimes you’re friends with someone due to proximity and convenience. \n\nThis thriller kept me guessing and I loved the well described atmosphere. \n✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\n\nIs this one on your radar?

He was certain of it. Even at his worst, which had reliably been found at the bottom of a bottle, he hadn’t hurt anyone, at least not too badly. Well at least not on purpose. Better, perhaps, to say that he never threw the first punch”. \n___________________________________\n\nHere is the synopsis:\n\nKit Webb has left his stand-and-deliver days behind him. But dreary days at his coffee shop have begun to make him pine for the heady rush of thievery. When a handsome yet arrogant aristocrat storms into his shop, Kit quickly realizes he may be unable to deny whatever this highborn man desires.\n\nIn order to save himself and a beloved friend, Percy, Lord Holland must go against every gentlemanly behavior he holds dear to gain what he needs most: a book that once belonged to his mother, a book his father never lets out of his sight and could be Percy’s savior. More comfortable in silk-filled ballrooms than coffee shops frequented by criminals, his attempts to hire the roughly hewn highwayman, formerly known as Gladhand Jack, proves equal parts frustrating and electrifying.\n\nKit refuses to participate in the robbery but agrees to teach Percy how to do the deed. Percy knows he has little choice but to submit and as the lessons in thievery begin, he discovers thievery isn’t the only crime he’s desperate to commit with Kit. \n\nBut when their careful plan goes dangerously wrong and shocking revelations threaten to tear them apart, can these stolen hearts overcome the impediments in their path?\n✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\n\nThe absolute perfect book for #pridemonth , grab it, it’s adorable. \n.\n.\n.\n#thequeerprinciplesofkitwebb #historicalfiction #romance #queerbooks #queerromance #regencyromance #humor #bookstagram #booktour #bookaesthetic #bookrecommendations #mustread #booksofinstagram #booksandcoffee #fortheloveofreading #bookblogger #instagood #instadaily #potd",

I was 28, and going through a divorce. To be honest I didn’t even notice a recession. My husband on the other hand was a 21 year old college student, who was let go from a retail job, only to find out that there weren’t many jobs. It hit him hard. It actually took him years to recover financially from that era. MONA AT SEA depicts an experience more like my husband’s. \n________________________________________\nSynopsis:\n\nMona is a Millennial perfectionist who fails upwards in the midst of the 2008 economic crisis.\n\nDespite her potential, and her top- of-her-class college degree, Mona finds herself unemployed, living with her parents, and adrift in life and love. Mona’s the sort who says exactly the right thing at absolutely the wrong moments, seeing the world through a cynic’s eyes. In the financial and social malaise of the early 2000s, Mona walks a knife’s edge as she faces down unemployment, underemployment, the complexities of adult relationships, and the downward spiral of her parents’ shattering marriage. The more Mona craves perfection and order, the more she is forced to see that it is never attainable.

And those that tell you to move past your grief just don’t understand your journey”. -Aunt Nora\n\n“Be curious first, judgmental a distant second.”- Francesco \n\nI loved this book so much. It’s a study in grief and loss. Immense loss. It’s 1988 and Kevin Doyle is a gay man living in NYC in the midst of the AIDS epidemic. He’s lost so many friends, but when he loses the love of his life, Francesco (Frankie) his life goes off the rails. Nothing matters anymore, he drinks himself into oblivion, gets fired from his job, and his friends are worried about him. After he nearly dies from alcohol poisoning, his friends know they need to help him make a change. So off he goes to Aunt Nora’s house in small town Minnesota where the memories of being in the closet surround him. \n\nI loved Aunt Nora. For 1988, and a Catholic, she loves and accepts her nephew in a way that would have been rare and made me cry a few times. I also love that his macho Minnesota best friend Tommy who supports and loves him. I feel like that would have been rare as well. \nThis book is beautiful, heartbreaking, uplifting, it’s a little bit of everything. \n.\n.\nFor more of Kevin Doyle’s story, read THE YEAR OF ICE, depicting his senior year of high school and his struggle to stay in the closet. \n.\n.\n#afterfrancesco #brianmalloy #bibliolifestyle #bookstagram #historicalfiction #gayfiction #mustread #coffeeandbooks #bookaesthetic #bookjunkie #readingtime #bookobsessed #bookreview #booksof2021 #lbgtq #readersofinstagram #booklover #bookrecommendations #instabooks #bookpost",

There’s such a great mix of humor and real issues though. Being the same age as the main character made me completely invested in her story.\n\nBells Walker is 42, finds out she’s pregnant after a failed IUD, and then that her family is moving to a small town called Pigkill. \nShe really tries to make the best of things, she’s wanted a bigger place for her growing family, she wants her husband to feel important in the university arena after trying for tenure..... but when she sees the dilapidated home, the savage mom groups, kombucha everywhere (!!!), she’s had enough. \nShe starts an anonymous blog about the people in her small town and calls herself the County Dutchess. It’s takes off like wildfire and Bells finally feels important for a change. She’s always sacrificing her wants and needs and boy it feels good to be writing. \nBut if comes at a cost. Someone figures out the person behind the blog and all hell breaks loose. \nPersonally I wanted her husband to be less self-centered and less selfish, but I think that’s part of the ultimate point. His mother obviously dotes on him, and his brothers success makes him a bit insecure. \n\nI find the observations Bells makes hilarious, I think overuse of the word millennial is intentional. The end is so sweet, and there is a moment with her teenage son that absolutely made me tear up. I really loved this book, highly recommend if you want a laugh with a side of substance. And maybe to find out what the hell a Bisnut is.\n.\n.\n.\nThank you so much @suzyapprovedbooktours & @leagellerauthor for my spot on this tour.

And it tackles them in such a unique way, with dual timelines and a “live in the now” approach. \n✨\nSynopsis:\n\nFor Conrad Burrell―husband, father, and successful attorney in the autumn of his life―the world has come apart. Having long ago lost his first wife, the mother of his grown daughter and a widow herself, to youth and pride, he’s now lost his second to a violent accident,. “You think you’re finished, that you have no more stories in you,” his ex-wife warns, and he fears she’s right. Within hailing distance of the end of his days, after a lifetime of meeting the expectations of others, none are left but Conrad’s own, and he must discover whether love survives death as well as divorce―whether family memory can redeem individual mortality.\n\nWhat do we do, then, we widows and widowers for whom there’s nothing left but the world’s permission to stop what we’ve done all our lives? In the cities of his youth, in the deserts of New Mexico, but most of all in a small Pennsylvania town, Conrad finds he has one more lesson in love to learn from the women of his past, and the one woman he's certain he can't live without.\n_____________________________________\n\nThis is out now for you to grab or order ❤️\n.\n.\n#whenwewereallstillalive \n@kmcwalter #booksparks #bookish #bookishlove #readersofinstagram #readingtime #bookcommunity #bookrecommendations #coffeelover #aesthetic #igblogger #bookstagrammer #instabooks #fortheloveofbooks",

In her life after retirement, she served  as a beacon of light for her family and community alike.  Her story is centered around the basic tenets of her life—no one is better than you, education is paramount, and asking questions can break barriers. The memoir captures the many facets of this unique woman: the curious “daddy’s girl,” pioneering professional, and sage elder. \n\nThis multidimensional portrait is also the record of a century of racial history that reveals the influential role educators at segregated schools and Historically Black Colleges and Universities played in nurturing the dreams of trailblazers like Katherine. The author pays homage to her mentor—the African American professor who inspired her to become a research mathematician despite having his own dream crushed by racism. \n____________________________________\nThank you so much to @tlcbooktours , @tlcdiversity & @amistadbooks for having me on this tour.

It doesn’t matter if it’s for boys or girls..... We don’t worry about what others think. Deal?”\n.\n.\nThere are so many moments I could choose from, but as the momma of a six-year old boy who asked me for hot pink shorts and pink shirt to match, we are no strangers to being judged for stupid crap. \nI digress. \n\nEveryone needs a Guncle (gay uncle) Patrick. A TV star on hiatus who has methodically pushed everyone away after losing the love of his life, he’s not exactly in a good place.\nWhen his brothers wife passes away and he goes home for the funeral, he’s confronted with the shock that the same brother is a pill addict. \nAlong with that he’s, going into treatment straight away and wants Patrick to watch over his two children Maisie and Grant for ninety days. \nPatrick can’t think of a worse idea or a worse person for such a task but he relents. The slow transformation between these three grieving people is stunning and there’s so much levity to offset the sad. I laughed so many times. I also cried. \nI’m not sure if I could have loved this one more. I was so impressed with Patrick’s sense of duty, it took my breath away. \nGrab this. You need it.

If you’re in #SanAntonio , give this place a try because everything is good. \n.\n.\nThis book though! Thank you @henryholtbooks for my copy of RIDGELINE , it is post Civil War fiction at it’s finest. \n.\n.\nSynopsis: \n\nIn 1866, with the country barely recovered from the Civil War, new war breaks out on the western frontier―a clash of cultures between the Native tribes who have lived on the land for centuries and a young, ambitious nation. Colonel Henry Carrington arrives in Wyoming’s Powder River Valley to lead the US Army in defending the opening of a new road for gold miners and settlers. Carrington intends to build a fort in the middle of critical hunting grounds, the home of the Lakota. Red Cloud, one of the Lakota’s most respected chiefs, and Crazy Horse, a young but visionary warrior, understand full well the implications of this invasion. For the Lakota, the stakes are their home, their culture, their lives.\n\nAs fall bleeds into winter, Crazy Horse leads a small war party that confronts Colonel Carrington’s soldiers with near constant attacks. Red Cloud, meanwhile, wants to build the tribal alliances that he knows will be necessary to defeat the soldiers. Colonel Carrington seeks to hold together a US Army beset with internal discord. Carrington’s officers are skeptical of their commander’s strategy, none more so than Lieutenant George Washington Grummond, who longs to fight a foe he dismisses as inferior in all ways. The rank-and-file soldiers, meanwhile, are still divided by the residue of civil war, and tempted to desertion by the nearby goldfields. \n____________________________________\n\nBased on real people, this one releases on June 1.

I’m fairly miserable, so I’m posting these Summer covers. They’re pretty and they make me happy. Also, that’s not coffee in my cup, it’s hot tea.\nBecause sick. Hurts to swallow. And cookies. Because tea and cookies. Biscuits if you’re in the UK. \n.\n.\nHave you read these? I haven’t, but MRS. EVERYTHING remains one of my favorite books. These two are likely much lighter but I like Jennifer Weiner’s writing style. \n.\n. \nAlright. Time to brew some more tea. @janinekayparham thank you so much for my soup. You’re a gem 💎. \nHappy Friday everyone, I hope it’s good. I got some good news about my  sister so no matter how shitty I feel, I’m floating on air. Aside from my son, she’s all that matters.

And helpful, you can find cousins, even put away killers. \nIn this book though, Paige Meyer finds out her beloved father, isn’t. A genealogy site tells her a certain Andy Abrams is her biological father. Her world is upended, and when she asks her mother Betsy, all is denied.\nThere is a switch between timelines throughout the book. College student Betsy Kaplan is dating sweet but boring Mark. Enter Andy who is popular, gregarious, a ladies man. Everything that her Betsy’s best friend Sissy wants for her. But Andy has secrets that he wants to keep hidden. One night he and Betsy decide to throw caution to the wind....\n.\n. \n.\nI love Paige’s best friends, Maks and Margaux, they are so supportive. I somewhat understand Betsy, can’t judge too much, it’s an impossible situation I think. Overall I loved this book so much, Allison Hammer is definitely an auto-buy for me.\n.\n.\n. \nHave you taken one of those genealogy tests? I plan on it. My sister did and found out some of her heritage is in Africa. We have different fathers so I’m curious to see what the differences will be.\n.\n\n.\n#littlepiecesofme #bookstagram #bookphotography #mustread #2021books #booksandcoffee #womensfiction #booklover #bookpost #igreads #fortheloveofreading #instabooks #readingtime #instalike #instalove #bookflatlay #picoftheday",

It combines family, food, grief, and love. \n\nExcerpt:\n\nEvery dish I cooked exhumed a memory. Every scent and taste brought me back for a moment to an unravaged home. Knife-cut noodles in chicken broth took me back to lunch at Myeongdong Gyoja after an afternoon of shopping, the line so long it filled a flight of stairs, extended out the door, and wrapped around the building. The kalguksu so dense from the rich beef stock and starchy noodles it was nearly gelatinous. My mother ordering more and more refills of their famously garlic- heavy kimchi. My aunt scolding her for blowing her nose in public. \n \nCrispy Korean fried chicken conjured bachelor nights with Eunmi. Licking oil from our fingers as we chewed on the crispy skin, cleansing our palates with draft beer and white radish cubes as she helped me with my Korean homework. Black- bean noodles summoned Halmoni slurping jjajangmyeon takeout, huddled around a low table in the living room with the rest of my Korean family. \n__________________________________________________\n.\nThank you so much to @booksparks @aaknopf for my gifted book and for including it in the #SRC2021 lineup.

Kicking off with the awesome Jenny Lee who’s hosting #SRC2021 , and her newest book “Anna K Away”. It’s the sequel to “Anna K” which I have yet to read, but definitely intend on. \n.\n.\nAbout the book:\n\nHow the mighty have fallen. Anna K, once the golden girl of Greenwich, CT, and New York City, has been brought low by a scandalous sex tape and the tragic death of her first love, Alexia Vronsky. At the beginning of the summer, her father takes her to the other side of the world, to connect with his family in South Korea and hide her away. Is Anna in exile? Or could this be her chance to figure out who she really is?\n\nBack in the U.S., Lolly has forgiven Steven for cheating on her, and their relationship feels stronger than ever. But when Lolly meets a boy at her beloved theater camp, she has to ask herself how well Steven will ever really know her. Meanwhile, in Manhattan, everything between Kimmie and her new boyfriend, Dustin, is easy―except when it comes to finally having sex. And Bea escapes to LA, running away from her grief at her beloved cousin’s death, until a beautiful stranger steals her heart. Is Bea ready to finally forgive Anna, and let herself truly fall in love for the very first time?\n___________________________________________\n\nI’m not a huge fan of Summer because I have a weird heat/sun intolerance, but I loooove books and I’m here for all the #summerreading ☀️\n.\n.\n.\n#annakaway #annak #booksparks #aapiauthors #ya #yareads #youngadultbooks #youngadult #youngadultfiction #bibliophile #bookstagram #bookishvibes #booksandcoffee #readwithme #bookphotography #instagood #instadaily #bookblogger #potd",

Thank you so much to @tlcbooktours , @williammorrowbooks & @gen_gannon for my gifted book.\n✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨\nTHE MOTHERS\nOut now! \nSYNOPSIS: \n\nGrace and Dan Arden are in their forties and have been on the IVF treadmill since the day they got married. Six attempts have yielded no results, and with each failure a little piece of their hope dies. \n\nPriya Laghari and her husband Nick Archer are being treated at the same fertility clinic, and while they don’t face the same time pressure as the Ardens, the younger couple have their own problems. \n\nOn the same day that Priya is booked for her next IVF cycle, Grace goes in for her final, last-chance embryo transfer. Two weeks later, both women get their results. \n\nA year on, angry and heartbroken, one of the women learns her embryo was implanted in the other’s uterus and must make a devastating choice: live a childless life knowing her son is being raised by strangers or seek custody of a baby who has been nurtured and loved by another couple. \n_________________________________________\nSo the crazy part about this book is that it’s based on the true story of an IVF lab mixup. I cannot imagine. I’m only a quarter through this but I can say that this is compelling right off. \n.\n.\nAlso don’t forget to visit @novelwicks for so many #bookish candles, use my code: AMANDA10 for 10% off❤️\n.\n.\nHow was your weekend? \n.\n.\n.\n#themothers #bookstagram #booksandcandles #lit #booklover #bookobsessed #bookinstagram #bookgeek #hyyge #coffeeandbooks #cozyvibes #readmorebooks #readersgonnaread #reading #instabooks #instalike #potd",

William Lewis\nPublishing on 6/1/2021\nThank you to @tlcbooktours & @greenleafbookgr for my gifted copy of this gorgeous book. \n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nProtagonist Kit Biddle is a rising prep school senior who finds himself tangled in a web of spiritual quandaries and intellectual absurdities. Kit’s angst is compounded by a unique psychological burden he is forced to carry: his intelligent but unstable Uncle Nat has committed an unspeakable act on what, according to the Uncle’s deranged account, were direct orders from God.\n\nThe tragedy haunting his family follows Kit like a dark and foreboding cloud, exacerbating his already compulsive struggle with existential questions about the meaning of his life. When the brilliant, perhaps phantasmic, Anna dismisses him, Kit quickly spirals into despair and self-destruction. But when his irrational decision to steal a maintenance truck and speed aimlessly down the highway ends in a horrific accident and months of both physical and emotional convalescence, Kit is forced to examine his perceptions of his life and his version of reality.\n_______________________________________\nThere’s something lovely about the coming-of-age sub genre, they always end up being my favorite books.

I don’t have regrets or lingering thoughts about much—— except parenting! Now, here’s the thing, I parent with mental illness piggybacking, so I am constantly reassessing my approach, my responses, my lack of interest in my son’s four hours of Beyblade tournaments....\n.\n.\nWith chapters like: \nDiscipline, Respect, Social Connections, the book is extremely easy to navigate. The section on mom guilt made me feel so much better. \nThere is a section called “What Does Acceptance Look Like?”. \nWell people I cried a little bit. Because sometimes I lose sight of my beautiful son in all of his glory, this miracle I finally was able to have, just because he won’t listen to something I’ve asked him to do several times😑. Yea, I’ve had a shit year, I’m sad, a lot. I fear that my son suffers from my own inadequacies and limitations. Depression is very limiting. \nBut this little book was enough for me to feel like enough for that moment.\nI really will recommend this to every parent I know. And maybe some of you all are really really confident, well rounded parents. Well I think I’d still recommend it because it has so many little gems that I think are universal. \n.\n.\nThank you for coming to my Ted-talk lol.

I graduated high school in 1997 so Nico is right around my age as this begins in 1993 and she’s 16. I absolutely loved every 90’s reference. Loved! The music especially because it completely consumed my existence back then. This book brought back vivid memories for me. However I was completely different from Nico in pretty much every way. I was pretty straight-laced I even called my mom to pick me up from parties when I felt like things weren’t safe or a good idea.\nI also called her when we skipped school to give her the address of where we went because safety people! I know, I was an odd mix of safety first and school sucks.\nOk onto the book.\n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nThey told me I was an out-of-control train about to crash…\n\nEverything changed when the police officer knocked on the door to tell me – a 16-year-old – that my older sister Kristen had died of a brain aneurysm. Cue the start of my parents neglecting me and my whole life spiraling out of control.\n\nI decided now was the perfect time to skip town. It’s the early 90’s, Kurt Cobain runs the grunge music scene and I just experienced some serious trauma. What’s a girl supposed to do? I didn’t want to end up like Kristen, so I grabbed my bucket list, turned up my mixtape of the greatest 90’s hits and fled L.A.. The goal was to end up at Kurt Cobain’s house in Seattle, but I never could have guessed what would happen along the way. \n_______________________________________________\nMan, I miss my Docs. \nAlright, what year did y’all graduate high school?

Twenty years later, transformed into soap opera star Eleanor Russell, she is fired under dubious circumstances.

Setting up house in a storybook cottage in the Hollywood Hills, Eleanor is cast in a dream role—the lead in a remake of Rebecca.

Thank you so much to @hodderstoughton & @beth_writes_stuff for my gifted copy.\n.\n.\nOnto my thoughts.... I rarely read post-apocalyptic literature. At least the new stuff, but I need to change that. Because this was completely immersive. \nThe year is 2024 and a plague called 6DM has eradicated the entire population as far as our unnamed narrator knows. She’s selfish, uncertain, flawed, more hotel than live off the land- she’s most of us. Which is what made this book a freakin’ page-turner. I don’t think I’d be remiss to say that this might not be the read for everyone, it’s pretty gruesome, there’s a certain rat incident that made my skin crawl, plus the sheer reality of what the body count would be and what that would mean is very well laid out. \nWe get glimpses of the narrators previous life through her journaling. Her relationships with her parents, best friends, her husband. And I think a lot of people won’t like her. However she’s as real as it gets. A few times I thought, that’s daft, at some of her choices, both before and after the apocalypse. Then I reframed it in my own personal terms and let me tell you, as far as post-apocalyptic goes, she’d beat me in a second. \nI think the big thing to consider is who are you when there’s no one to impress, no social mores, nothing to tell you what to be anymore..... and maybe some of the things she does will shock the reader, but I find them pretty realistic. Plus she’s someone with mental health issues and I completely appreciate that facet of her story. \n.\n.\nI hope some of you grab this one, I found it to be the book I didn’t know I needed to read. \nWhat is a book that surprised you? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#lastoneattheparty #bookstagram #postapocalyptic #postapocalypse #darkhumor #booksofinstagram #scifi #dystopian #womensfiction #bookphotography #photography #readersgonnaread #igreads #cozy #hygge #coffeeandbooks #bookaesthetic #booklover #bookworm #instadaily #instamood #picoftheday #bookblog",

Taylor\nThank you to {partner} @harpercollins , @tlcbooktours @cltaylorauthor \n☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️\n\n#mythoughts :\nCL Taylor’s books have been on my Amazon wishlist for a long time, so when presented with a tour I jumped! And I wasn’t disappointed. \n.\n.\nWhen Fran’s sister Jenna disappeared two years ago on a retreat, it fractured her family. And her if she’s being honest. A large age difference and vast personality differences meant that Fran didn’t get as close to her as she would have liked. \nHer regret, complied with nagging questions propel Fran into uncharted territory, desperate to get answers about her sister. So she signs up for a retreat run by the same duo that lost three people, including Jenna two years ago, Tom Wade and and Kate. \n\nTom served his time in prison for the disaster that happened, but before that he was the head of Soul Shrink, which had a massive social media following and many devout fans. Kate pushes him to restart the idea and so a new retreat is born. The very one that Fran is on.\n\nI loved Fran’s can-do personality, and felt really sad for the space she put between herself and people in general.\nJenna just seemed like she needed direction. Both the women’s issues stemming from different parental expectations. \n\nTom was a weakling, I didn’t like him. But I kinda liked not liking him. Kate reminded me of Marla from the “I Care A lot” Movie. \n\nThroughout the book I suspected pretty much everyone so I loved that it kept me guessing. I did not see the end coming!\nLoved this one, can’t want to read more by Taylor. \nThis one published on 4/27, so you can grab it now!\nThat cover😍\n.\n.\n.\n#herlastholiday #cltaylor #bookstagram #bibliophile #thriller #thrillerbooks #domesticthriller #booklover #bookpic #bookflatlay #bookish #reading #readmorebooks #igreads #2021books #photography #booktography #bookgeek #bookobsessed #bookaesthetic #coffeeandbooks #booksandcandles #cozyhome #instadaily #instamood #picoftheday",

Yet here she is―cancer free. So why doesn’t she feel more alive?\n\nSure, Libby’s husband, Shiloh, has been distant. One of their daughters has a serious health condition. And her father’s death hovers over Libby like a rain cloud. Still, this eternal optimist knows she’s the winner of the existential lottery.\n\nBut when her forced cheer isn’t enough to keep her family from catching her blahs, she decides to fly them all to Vieques. The Puerto Rican island is where she and Shiloh fell in love―and where she decided to fight for her life after her cancer diagnosis. Where better to put their problems into perspective?\n\nThen a tropical storm strikes. Libby pretends everything’s fine, even as she fears she’s doomed her family. What she can’t see is that the worst disaster they’ve faced may be the best thing that ever happened to them. But first, they have to get through it.\n__________________________________________________\n\nOk, I so only started reading This Won’t End Well, as well as Don’t Make Me Turn This Life Around, but I love Camille pagán’s writing!

This gem was released in paperback on May 4, 2021. \n\nThank you{partners: @bibliolifestyle & @harperviabooks } \nBy: #gailtsukiyama \n.\n.\nDaniel Abe, a young doctor in Chicago is finally coming back to Hawai'i. He has his own reason for returning to his childhood home, but it is not to revisit the past, unlike his Uncle Koji. Koji lives with the memories of Daniel’s mother, Mariko, the love of his life, and the scars of a life hard-lived. He can’t wait to see Daniel, who he’s always thought of as a son, but he knows the time has come to tell him the truth about his mother, and his father. But Daniel’s arrival coincides with the awakening of the Mauna Loa volcano, and its dangerous path toward their village stirs both new and long ago passions in their community.\n\nAlternating between past and present—from the day of the volcano eruption in 1935 to decades prior—The Color of Airinterweaves the stories of Daniel, Koji, and Mariko to create a rich, vibrant, bittersweet chorus that celebrates their lifelong bond to one other and to their immigrant community. As Mauna Loa threatens their lives and livelihoods, it also unearths long held secrets simmering below the surface that meld past and present, revealing a path forward for them all.\n\n_______________________________________________\nThe writing in this is so vivid and descriptive, the story so multi-layered, I’m enjoying lingering on each page. \n.\n.\nHappy Sunday everyone ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#booktour #thecolorofair #bibliolifestyle #bookaesthetic #bibliophile #aapiheritagemonth #aapi #cozyvibes #historicalfiction #booktography #igreads #paperback #coverart #aapiauthors #mustread #bookaholic #bookaddict #readmorebooks #readersgonnaread #instadaily #instalove #picoftheday",

It comes out on May 25, 2021 so pre-order this beauty. I’m 49 pages in and I am enthralled. I love small town settings and undying love. Here’s the synopsis:\n\nPiper Parrish's life on Frick Island—a tiny, remote town smack in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay—is nearly perfect. Well, aside from one pesky detail: Her darling husband, Tom, is dead. When Tom's crab boat capsized and his body wasn't recovered, Piper, rocked to the core, did a most peculiar thing: carried on as if her husband was not only still alive, but right there beside her, cooking him breakfast, walking him to the docks each morning, meeting him for their standard Friday night dinner date at the One-Eyed Crab. And what were the townspeople to do but go along with their beloved widowed Piper? \n \nAnders Caldwell’s career is not going well. A young ambitious journalist, he’d rather hoped he’d be a national award-winning podcaster by now, rather than writing fluff pieces for a small town newspaper. But when he gets an assignment to travel to the remote Frick Island and cover their boring annual Cake Walk fundraiser, he stumbles upon a much more fascinating tale: an entire town pretending to see and interact with a man who does not actually exist. Determined it’s the career-making story he’s been needing for his podcast, Anders returns to the island to begin covert research and spend more time with the enigmatic Piper—but he has no idea out of all the lives he’s about to upend, it’s his that will change the most. \n____________________________________________\nFor an entire town to love someone so much as to play into their delusion is just beautiful. It reminds me a little bit of the movie “Lars and the Real Girl” with Ryan Gosling. \n.\n.\nHappy Friday everyone ❤️.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#theinvisiblehusbandoffrickisland #bookstagram #bookish #bookstalove #romance #bookphotography #bookaesthetic #2021books #mustread #tbr #lit #coffeeandbooks #fortheloveofreading #readersofinstagram #igbooks #bookblogger #instalike #instadaily #potd",

Yea that’s right, I said it.\nThey both have similar central themes: the meaning of life, what makes it worth living, it’s the little things....\nHowever, HTST is far more nuanced and slow-building. Some might struggle to find a plot I think. But my goodness does Matt Haig have a special way of encompassing the human condition and then putting it on a page. \n.\n.\nAbout the book:\nTom Hazard is afflicted with a condition that makes him age extremely slowly. By the time he looks 40, he is in reality centuries old. It may seem like a gift to live so long, but it’s very much a curse. Tom has lived long enough to see history repeat itself, to see loved ones get old or sick and die. He can never stay in one place for very long because the truth of his condition must stay a secret. He is protected by the Albatross Society, a group of people like him. \nBy the time we find Tom at age “40” he is tired of the drudgery that is living. And he misses the love of his life. He’s missed her for 300 years or so, which  is a really long time to mourn. He wants a normal life but knows that is impossible. So what is it that he wakes up for each day? It is something he ponders constantly. And something we might take for granted. \nIf you’re not reading @mattzhaig , what are you doing with your life??\n.\n.\nIf you could live a thousand years, would you want to?\n.\n.\n#howtostoptime #magicalrealism #fantasy #mustread #bookaholic #bookobsessed #bookworm #bookaesthetic #beautifulbooks #cozy #hyggehome #bibliophile #bookphotography #fortheloveofreading #booknerd #readmorebooks #readersofig #igreads #potd #bookrecommendations #bookblogger #instadaily",

Thank you {partner}@bibliolifestyle & @williammorrowbooks for my gifted copy. \n.\n.\nSynopsis:\nInvestigating the killing of a prisoner during a riot inside a state penitentiary, GBI investigator Will Trent is confronted with disturbing information. One of the inmates claims that he is innocent of a brutal attack for which he has always been the prime suspect. The man insists that he was framed by a corrupt law enforcement team led by Jeffrey Tolliver and that the real culprit is still out there—a serial killer who has systematically been preying on women across the state for years. If Will reopens the investigation and implicates the dead police officer with a hero’s reputation of wrongdoing, the opportunistic convict is willing to provide the information GBI needs about the riot murder.\n\nOnly days ago, another young woman was viciously murdered in a state park in northern Georgia. Is it a fluke, or could there be a serial killer on the loose?\n\nAs Will Trent digs into both crimes it becomes clear that he must solve the cold case in order to find the answer. Yet nearly a decade has passed—time for memories to fade, witnesses to vanish, evidence to disappear, and lies to become truth. But Will can’t crack either mystery without the help of the one person he doesn’t want involved: his girlfriend and Jeffrey Tolliver’s widow, medical examiner Sara Linton.\n\nWhen the past and present begin to collide, Will realizes that everything he values is at stake . . .\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nIf you are a Slaughter fan, you will love this book. It’s the tenth book in the Will Trent series, but it has elements and characters from her Grant County series as well. \n.\n.\nHave you read any Karin Slaughter?\nI really like her stand alone books. \n.\n.\n.\n#thesilentwife #karinslaughter #bibliolifestyle #thriller #crimefiction #thrillerbooks #booksandcoffee #paperback #bookseries #booklover #bibliophile #readmorebooks #mustread #bookrecommendations #instalike #bookblogger #bookinspo",

In the harshness of winter, her family must join the largest exodus in human history to survive. As battle lines are drawn and East Prussia’s borders vanish beneath them, they leave their farm and all they know behind for an uncertain future.\n\nBut Ilse also has Janusz, her family’s young Polish laborer, by her side. As they flee from the Soviet army, his enchanting folktales keep her mind off the cold, the hunger, and the horrors unfolding around them. He tells her of a besieged kingdom in the Baltic Sea from which spill the amber tears of a heartbroken queen.\n\nNot far away, trying and failing to flee from a vengeful army, Arno and his mother hide in the ruins of a Königsberg mansion, hoping that once the war ends they can reunite their dispersed family. But their stay in the walled city proves untenable when they find themselves dodging bombs and scavenging in the rubble.

All of the stories are endearing, but my favorite is one about a nurse and her husband with early onset Alzheimer’s. Cried my eyes out. \nI’m so glad I finally picked this up!

Linnea starts caring for her niece, Hope, as a nanny, and then things shut down, there is a case of Covid in the family. Other people are trying to get home which proves difficult. Linnea eventually houses her close friend Anna and her brother Cooper who is home from college. \nTwo men are vying for Linnea’s heart, and I absolutely love her choice in the end. \nThe whole book is about rolling with it. Being able to roll with whatever changes come your way because that elasticity in life is what keeps you afloat when things are uncertain and rocky. \nThank you Suzy for having me on tour❤️\n.\n.\n. \n.\n#thesummeroflostandfound #maryalicemonroe #gallerybooks #suzyapprovedbooktours #bookstagram #summervibes #beautifulbooks #chicklit #womensfiction #romance #coffeelover #coffeeandbooks #cozyhome #instadaily #bookreview #picoftheday",

Particularly when it involves money, politics, and teenagers. \nGrace and Mimi are an unlikely pair, Grace being the buttoned-up traditional and Mimi the blue haired, don’t care bold one of the two. \nThey are at odds with a school budget plan involving throwing money towards sports or science. In their ten-year friendship they’ve never fought or kept anything from each other. Mimi who’s son Rowan is a football player, wants the budget to go that way, Grace, who’s son Carter is more interested in academia wants money thrown to that arena. Both mothers are interested in getting their sons into the best colleges they can. With differing abilities, the budget could help one or the other boy.\nHowever, when Carter is brutally injured in an accident at Mimi’s house, Grace and Mimi may never be the same.\n.\n.\nI must admit, I liked Mimi’s character more than Grace’s, although I completely understood through her backstory where her issues stemmed from. I love that Mimi, even through her own pain and strife, continued to pray and wish goodwill towards Carter. That’s a real friend, one who loves your child even when there are problems in your friendship. Which brings me the other part I loved and that is the importance of female friendship in the book. You need those ladies who are always there for you, through thick and thin.

First, I read a review by @mattyandthebooks on Goodreads, then, I saw @jordys.book.club ‘s post. \n.\n.\nMoved. Up. The. List.\n.\n.\nIt starts off with a letter from a father to his daughter in 1972. Sweet enough. But there’s nothing saccharine about this book. It combines so many literary elements and devices astonishingly well, it’s compelling to say the least.\n.\n.\n.\nAbout the book:\n\nJosephine Morrow is Girl One, the first of nine “Miracle Babies” conceived without male DNA, raised on an experimental commune known as the Homestead. When a suspicious fire destroys the commune and claims the lives of two of the Homesteaders, the remaining Girls and their Mothers scatter across the United States and lose touch.\n\nYears later, Margaret Morrow goes missing, and Josie sets off on a desperate road trip, tracking down her estranged sisters who seem to hold the keys to her mother’s disappearance. Tracing the clues Margaret left behind, Josie joins forces with the other Girls, facing down those who seek to eradicate their very existence while uncovering secrets about their origins and unlocking devastating abilities they never knew they had.\n\nA spellbinding supernatural thriller, Girl One combines the provocative imagination of Naomi Alderman's The Power with the propulsive, cinematic storytelling of a Marvel movie. In her electrifying new novel, Sara Flannery Murphy digs deep into women’s extraordinary power and reveals an unassailable truth: so much strength lies in numbers.\n______________________________________________\n\nSci-fi, medical thriller, genetic engineering, women’s fiction.

I also love when the best friend is secretly pining for the best friend. I’m not a huge fan of romance, however there is a caveat: when it involves friendships I tend to really want to see where it goes. There’s often so much history and poignant moments, I can’t resist. And this book has it all. \n.\n. \nSynopsis: \n\nEve, Justin, Susie, and Ed have been friends since they were teenagers. Now in their thirties, the four are as close as ever, Thursday night bar trivia is sacred, and Eve is still secretly in love with Ed. Maybe she should have moved on by now, but she can’t stop thinking about what could have been. And she knows Ed still thinks about it, too.\n\nBut then, in an instant, their lives are changed forever.\n\nIn the aftermath, Eve’s world is upended. As stunning secrets are revealed, she begins to wonder if she really knew her friends as well as she thought. And when someone from the past comes back into her life, Eve’s future veers in a surprising new direction...\n\nThey say every love story starts with a single moment. What if it was just last night?\n\n__________________________________________\n\nThe beginning starts with “after”, so you know it’s going to be a lot of flashback and I’m so there for it! \n.\n.\nWhat’s gonna get you through this morning? Coffee? Tea? Scrolling through Instagram for new books to add?

Thank you to @berkleypub , @netgalley & @smariedowning for my e-galley of FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. \nThis is out on 7/20/2021 and you need it. Add it. You’re welcome. \n.\n.\nEarly thoughts:\nTeddy, Teddy, Teddy.... you’re a different brand of diabolical. Where’s your wife, bro? You can’t stand entitlement but you teach at a top rated private school. You’ve read Bleak House (call me impressed). You like Gold Roast coffee. And, I’m absolutely hooked. Read the synopsis below.\n_________________________________________\n\nTeddy Crutcher has won Teacher of the Year at the prestigious Belmont Academy, home to the best and brightest. \n \nHe says his wife couldn’t be more proud—though no one has seen her in a while. \n \nTeddy really can’t be bothered with a few mysterious deaths on campus that’re looking more and more like murder or the student digging a little too deep into Teddy’s personal life. His main focus is pushing these kids to their full academic potential. \n \nAll he wants is for his colleagues—and the endlessly meddlesome parents—to stay out of his way. If not, well, they’ll get what they deserve. \n \nIt’s really too bad that sometimes excellence can come at such a high cost.\n**********************************************\n\nToday is my sisters 29th birthday and I can’t wait to celebrate with her and my family. \n.\n.\nHappy Sunday everyone, what are you grateful for today? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#ForYourOwnGood #samanthadowning #bookstagram #2021books #thriller #thrillerbooks #mustread #tbr #fortheloveofreading #cozyvibes #bibliophile #bookphotography #readersofinstagram #bookbabe #igreads #booklover #bookaesthetic #booknerd #instadaily #instalike #bookblogger #picoftheday",

It’s beautiful, heartbreaking, surreal, and I loved it. \nFirst of all, it’s the first time I have ever seen the term Balanced Translocation in fiction. That means a great deal to me because it is why I personally kept losing babies. Like Mia, I had the longest pregnancy I’d yet had, convinced she was mine to keep. Like Mia, at one point I was pretty sure I didn’t want babies until one day, I did. I met my Harrison @randallondrums ❤️. \n.\n.\nThat’s the end of the parallels because in Mia’s life, she is dreaming of the same stranger, for years. She’s dreamed of him for long enough that he seems real. \nUntil he is. And she must explore what that means. \nThere is a lot of dream talk, what they mean, symbolism, even a psychic is brought in. This books wraps up beautifully in my mind. Because no matter what you dream, your life is made up of your choices. I loved Mia’s best friend Raya for grounding her, that conversation they have is everything. I ugly cried at this book, because I loved it. \n.\n.\n.\nWhat are you reading this weekend? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #youweretheretoo #romancebooks #romance #womensfiction #infertility #bibliophile #cozyhome #hygge #latte #coffeeandbooks #balancedtranslocation #beigeaesthetic #neutralstyle #photography #booksofinstagram #igreads #reading #booklover #bookgeek #instalike #instamoment #picoftheday #bookblogger",

I am loving this cover and the book as well. \nSTORMLAND by John Shirley is the post-apocalyptic break I’m needing right now. \n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nThey call it Stormland: a sprawling, largely abandoned region of the southeastern coast of the USA, where climate change's extreme weather conditions have brought about a ''perfect storm'' of perpetual tempests; where hurricane-strength storms return day after day, 365 days a year.\n\nThe heart of Stormland is Charleston, South Carolina, a flooded ruin where hundreds of people remain for their own peculiar reasons; where thugs prey on the weak, and a strangely benevolent cult tries to keep everyone insanely sane. Here, plutocratic evil takes advantage of Stormland's lawlessness to cultivate a weirdly puppeted theater of cruelty.\n\nSwept into the turbulent vortex of Stormland is an unlikely duo -- a former serial killer and a former US Marshal -- who must work together to bring light to America's late twenty-first century heart of darkness.\n\nA cyberpunk detective thriller set in a maelstrom of climatic upheaval, classism, and corrupt power, Stormland paradoxically dramatizes the resilience of the human spirit.\n______________________________________________\n\nI love it when it rains, but this is deliciously terrifying.

Panic-stricken upon sending her absence from the hive, they rapidly breed new queens”. \n.\nAbout the book:\n\nFrom an award-winning Tunisian author comes a stirring allegory about a country in the aftermath of revolution and the power of a single quest.\n\nSidi lives a hermetic life as a bee whisperer, tending to his beloved “girls” on the outskirts of the desolate North African village of Nawa. He wakes one morning to find that something has attacked one of his beehives, brutally killing every inhabitant. Heartbroken, he soon learns that a mysterious swarm of vicious hornets committed the mass murder—but where did they come from, and how can he stop them? If he is going to unravel this mystery and save his bees from annihilation, Sidi must venture out into the village and then brave the big city and beyond in search of answers.\n\nAlong the way, he discovers a country and a people turned upside down by their new post–Arab Spring reality as Islamic fundamentalists seek to influence votes any way they can on the eve of the country’s first democratic elections. To succeed in his quest, and find a glimmer of hope to protect all that he holds dear, Sidi will have to look further than he ever imagined.\n___________________________________________\nThank you to @tlcbooktours & @tlcdiversity for my spot on this tour and gifted book.

He’s got a couple close friends, a steady paycheck working for a regional airline, and of course, for a few glorious days each Fall, college football tailgates. He considers himself to be a mostly lucky guy—despite the fact that he’s suffered from a debilitating disease since he was a small child, one that has left him unable to speak or to move without a wheelchair. \n\nLargely confined to his home, Daniel spends the hours he’s not online communicating with irate air travelers observing his neighborhood from his front porch. One young woman passes by so frequently that spotting her out the window has almost become part of his daily routine. Until the day he’s almost sure he sees her being kidnapped...\n___________________________________________\n\nI’ve started this and it’s just as good as I thought if would be.

Sadie Gault is eighteen and living with her parents in the Kraków Ghetto during World War II.

Hey invasive anxiety and fear- “I’m Speaking”. \n.\n. \nHow is your weekend treating you so far? \nLove to all❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booksbooksbooks #imspeaking #coffeeandbooks #whatcomesafter #beautifulbooks #bookobsessed #booklover #saturdayvibes #cozyhome #fortheloveofbooks #whattoreadnext #igreads #booksofinstagram #reading #bookishlove #booklife #bookblogger #instabooks #instadaily #picoftheday",

This is my first Jónasson book but it won’t be my last.\n.\n.\nUna is a wayward thirty year-old living in a big city. While all of her friends and family are moving up and on, Una is stuck. So when her friend Sara shows her and advert for a teacher wanted for the tiny town of Skálar at the edge of Iceland, she applies. When she gets to the tiny town of ten people, it’s cold, forbidding and Una thinks she’s made a mistake. She tries to stay positive though and stick it out. That decision proves difficult in the face of unfriendly people and territory.\n.\n.\n#mythoughts :\nAtmospheric doesn’t even begin to describe this book! Misty, foggy, I could almost taste the salty sea air. \nI really liked Una, I felt for her, wanted her to find something after the personal tragedy she experienced. But my gosh Skálar and its residents are so unfriendly! I loved the way the mystery played out and was wrapped up. I loved the sheer creepiness.

I love our conversations, I love that I never feel weird spilling my soul to you. You’re just too wonderful ❤️. \n.\n.\n.\nAbout the book:\nTwelve years ago, Cody Boggs and Louisa Chambers made a pact that no matter where their lives took them, they’d return to Nantucket Island’s Brant Point Lighthouse on July 30, their shared golden birthday, and continue their tradition of exchanging birthday wishes. But that was before a tragic accident upended both of their lives, irrevocably pulling them apart. \n\nTheir worlds collide just months before that particular day when Louisa’s fledgling event planning company is hired by the local Coast Guard station, where she discovers Cody has recently returned to the island as the second in command. As they plan a regatta fundraiser, hoping to promote positive PR in the community, neither can deny the fireworks each encounter ignites. But working together also brings up memories of the day Cody’s father died, revealing secrets that have Cody and Louisa questioning everything they thought they knew and felt about their families and each other.\n______________________________________________\n\nIf you need a good romance, I found you one.

Sometimes neighbors save your sanity, give you newfound hope. Love you @janinekayparham ❤️❤️❤️\n.\n.\nSynopsis:\nFor fans of The Keeper of Lost Things and Evvie Drake Starts Over comes a funny and tender debut about a reclusive artist whose collection has gotten out of control—but whose unexpected friendship with a pair of new neighbors might be just what she needs to start over. \n\nAmy Ashton once dreamed of becoming an artist—of creating beautiful objects. But now she simply collects them. Aquamarine bottles, bright yellow crockery, deep Tuscan red pots (and the odd slow-cooker) take up every available inch of space in her house. Having suffered a terrible tragedy—one she staunchly refuses to let herself think about, thank you very much—she’s decided that it’s easier to love things than people. Things are safe. Things will never leave you. \n\nBut when a new family moves in next door with two young boys, one of whom has a collection of his own, Amy’s carefully managed life starts to unravel, prompting her to question why she began to close herself off in the first place. As Amy embarks on a journey back into her past, she has to contend with nosy neighbors, a meddlesome government worker, the inept police, and a little boy whose love of bulldozers might just let Amy open up her heart—and her home—again. \n__________________________________________\n\nThis one publishes on 6/8/2021 and I can’t not love it. That’s right, I said it, double negative, but I couldn’t think of anything else.

As girls, they invented Mirrorland, a dark, imaginary place under the pantry stairs full of pirates, witches, and clowns. These days Cat rarely thinks about their childhood home, or the fact that El now lives there with her husband Ross. \n\nBut when El mysteriously disappears after going out on her sailboat, Cat is forced to return to 36 Westeryk Road, which has scarcely changed in twenty years. The grand old house is still full of shadowy corners, and at every turn Cat finds herself stumbling on long-held secrets and terrifying ghosts from the past. Because someone—El?—has left Cat clues in almost every room: a treasure hunt that leads right back to Mirrorland, where she knows the truth lies crouched and waiting... \n\nA twisty, dark, and brilliantly crafted thriller about love and betrayal, redemption and revenge, Mirrorland is a propulsive, page-turning debut about the power of imagination and the price of freedom.\n__________________________________________\n\nI’m absolutely loving this one so much and I love that is came with a little mirror.

Thank you so much to @tlcbooktours & @minotaur_books for my gifted book. \n.\n.\n“The Stills” is the third installment in The Kinship series. \n.\n.\nSynopsis: \n\nOhio, 1927: Moonshining is a way of life in rural Bronwyn County, and even the otherwise upstanding Sheriff Lily Ross has been known to turn a blind eye when it comes to stills in the area. But when thirteen-year-old Jebediah Ranklin almost dies after drinking tainted moonshine, Lily knows that someone has gone too far, and―with the help of organizer and moonshiner Marvena Whitcomb―is determined to find out who.\n\nBut then, Lily’s nemesis, the businessman George Vogel, reappears in town with his new wife, Fiona. Along with them is also her former brother-in-law Luther Ross, now an agent for the newly formed Bureau of Prohibition. To Lily, it seems too much of a coincidence that they should arrive now.\n\nAs fall turns to winter, a blizzard closes in. Lily starts to peel back the layers of deception shrouding the town of Kinship, but soon she discovers that many around her seem to be betraying those they hold dear―and that Fiona too may have an agenda of her own.\n________________________________________\nIf you’re looking for a fantastic #historicalmystery series/book I highly recommend this one.

Thanks to everyone tagged for these amazing reads! #swipe to see the gorgeous covers!\n.\n.\nSpecial thank you to @emilyraustinauthor for sending me a copy of #everyoneinthisroomwillsomedaybedead . Its out on July 6, 2021 and the premise grabbed me! \nSynopsis:\n\nGilda, a twenty-something, atheist, animal-loving lesbian, cannot stop ruminating about death. Desperate for relief from her panicky mind and alienated from her repressive family, she responds to a flyer for free therapy at a local Catholic church, and finds herself being greeted by Father Jeff, who assumes she’s there for a job interview. Too embarrassed to correct him, Gilda is abruptly hired to replace the recently deceased receptionist Grace. \n\nIn between trying to memorize the lines to Catholic mass, hiding the fact that she has a new girlfriend, and erecting a dirty dish tower in her crumbling apartment, Gilda strikes up an email correspondence with Grace’s old friend. She can’t bear to ignore the kindly old woman, who has been trying to reach her friend through the church inbox, but she also can’t bring herself to break the bad news. Desperate, she begins impersonating Grace via email. But when the police discover suspicious circumstances surrounding Grace’s death, Gilda may have to finally reveal the truth of her mortifying existence. \n_________________________________________\nSome of these are tours so I’ll be posting soon on them.

Will Hunter get into Stanford and still be able to maintain his relationship with the “it girl” Sierra Jones? Will Trisha find love with outsider Ray Martinez and figure out what’s going on with her influencer best friend, Pamela Shah? Will billionaire newcomer Jack Zhou figure out how to fit in? And who exactly is The Stranger? Welcome to Winchester High, a prestigious college preparatory school where students live seemingly perfect, privileged lives.\n\nIn Not THAT Rich, we find that things are not always what they seem, and no matter how much money, power or influence you think you have, high school will always be complicated.\n________________________________________________\nYou can grab this one right now and you should.

I was prepared to do some shady sh’*t to get this one. \nThis woman writes dark, break-neck, wtf twists like no one else. I’m here for it!!!🙌🏼\n.\n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nThomas and Viv Adler are the envy of their neighbors: attractive, successful, with well-mannered children and a beautifully restored home. \n\nUntil one morning, when they wake up to find their porch has been pelted with eggs. It’s a prank, Thomas insists; the work of a few out-of-control kids. But when a smoke bomb is tossed on their front lawn, and their car’s tires are punctured, the family begins to worry. Surveillance cameras show nothing but grainy images of shadowy figures in hoodies. And the police dismiss the attacks, insisting they’re just the work of bored teenagers. Unable to identify the perpetrators, the Adlers are helpless as the assaults escalate into violence, and worse. And each new violation brings with it a growing fear. Because everyone in the Adler family is keeping a secret—not just from the outside world, but from each other. And secrets can be very dangerous….\n____________________________________________\nHahahaha yea.... those secrets, they kill ya!

Here’s the synopsis:\n\nBe careful what you wish for.\n\nWhen social worker Jax receives nine missed calls from her older sister, Lexie, she assumes that it’s just another one of her sister’s episodes. Manic and increasingly out of touch with reality, Lexie has pushed Jax away for over a year. But the next day, Lexie is dead: drowned in the pool at their grandmother’s estate. When Jax arrives at the house to go through her sister’s things, she learns that Lexie was researching the history of their family and the property. And as she dives deeper into the research herself, she discovers that the land holds a far darker past than she could have ever imagined.\n\nIn 1929, thirty-seven-year-old newlywed Ethel Monroe hopes desperately for a baby. In an effort to distract her, her husband whisks her away on a trip to Vermont, where a natural spring is showcased by the newest and most modern hotel in the Northeast. Once there, Ethel learns that the water is rumored to grant wishes, never suspecting that the spring takes in equal measure to what it gives. \n.\n.\n.\nI suspect this is on a lot of people’s radar, and if it isn’t, it should be!

Technically I just started #TheLostApothecary so that’s my #currentlyreading lol. \n.\n.\nAll of these have been 4-5 star reads for me. However my favorite was #SorrowandBliss . It touches the topic of mental illness with raw language. It also explores the impact mental illness has on every relationship in said mentally ill person’s life. That’s was a confusing sentence but my meds are making me a bit fuzzy. Yep I take meds for my mental health and I’m not afraid to say it. \nSorrow and Bliss is darkly humorous but if you’re not really aware of that genre, you might miss it.

I started watching and reading everything I could in the way of statistics, personal stories, sociological impact. \nI’ve now moved on to fiction. Well researched fiction gives a well rounded voice to the statistics. \n.\n\n.\n. \nBrian Malloy has written a raw look at grief in 28-year-old Kevin Doyle. Kevin goes to a lot of funerals, even describing “orthodox” and “conservative” AIDS funerals. The former being one in which no one mentions the partner of the dead and pretends they weren’t gay. The latter in which the partner situs with the family as a roommate or best friend. \n.\n.\n.\n.\nFrancesco has been gone for three years now and Kevin is still holding on to the man and the memories that were the best of his life. We get Francesco’s voice through Kevin’s imagination, he still talks to him as though he’s there. He still lives in their apartment, unwilling to move on. \nWhen he finally realizes it’s time to start trying to live again, he moves back home to Minnesota. \n.\n\n.\n.\nI still have to read the end, but this book is a truthful study in grief and loss and love. I’m drawn to reading about those processes because I have a difficult time with them. \nI think if you liked “The Great Believers” you’d like this one. \nAfter Francesco releases on 5/25/2021. \n.\nI hope you all are having a great Sunday.

Leslie wants to. This is such a witty, heartfelt, multi-topic read for everyone. I really do think these are subjects that everyone can ponder and be aware of, and are relatable. \n.\n.\nSynopsis:\nAuthor Leslie Lehr wants to talk about boobs. She’s gone from size AA to DDD and everything between, from puberty to motherhood, enhancement to cancer, and beyond. And she’s not alone—these are classic life stages for women today.\n\nAt turns funny and heartbreaking, A Boob’s Life explores both the joys and hazards inherent to living in a woman’s body. Lehr deftly blends her personal narrative with national history, starting in the 1960s with the women’s liberation movement and moving to the current feminist dialogue and what it means to be a woman. Her insightful and clever writing analyzes how America’s obsession with the female form has affected her own life’s journey and the psyche of all women today.\n\n*Now in development with Salma Hayak as a TV series for HBO Max*\n\n___________________________________________\nAvailable now!

Thank you so much to #partner : @bibliolifestyle & @harperviabooks for having me on tour!\n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nAntonio is eighteen years old and on the cusp of adulthood. His father, a brilliant mathematician, hasn’t played a large part in his life since divorcing Antonio’s mother but when Antonio is diagnosed with epilepsy, they travel to Marseille to visit a doctor who may hold the hope for an effective treatment. It is there, in a foreign city, under strained circumstances, that they will get to know each other and connect for the first time.\n\nA beautiful, gritty, and charming port city where French old-world charm meets modern bohemia, father and son stroll the streets sharing strained small talk. But as the hours pass and day gives way to night, the two find themselves caught in a series of caffeine-imbued adventures involving unexpected people (and unforeseen trysts) that connect father and son for the first time. As the two discuss poetry, family, sex, math, death, and dreams, their experience becomes a mesmerizing 48-hour microcosm of a lifetime relationship. Both learn much about illusions and regret, about talent and redemption, and, most of all, about love. \n\nElegant, warm, and tender, set against the vivid backdrop of 1980s Marseille and its beautiful calanques—a series of cliffs and bays on the city’s outskirts—Three O’Clock in the Morning is a bewitching coming-of-age story imbued with nostalgia and a revelatory exploration of time and fate, youth and adulthood. \n________________________________________________\nThe writing in this is beautiful, the imagery impeccable. \nPublishing on 3/16/2021.

An Amazon first reads selection for the month of March, if you want a WW2 book full of strong women, here’s one you’ll love. \n.\n.\n. \n\nSynopsis:\nAnna Cavanaugh is a restless young widow and brilliant French teacher at a private school in Washington, DC. Everything changes when she’s recruited into the Office of Strategic Services by family friend and legendary WWI hero Major General William Donovan.\n\nDonovan has faith in her―and in all his “glorious amateurs” who are becoming Anna’s fast friends: Maggie, Anna’s down-to-earth mentor; Irene, who’s struggling to find support from her husband for her clandestine life; and Julia, a cheerful OSS liaison. But the more Anna learns about the organization’s secret missions, the more she longs to be stationed abroad. Then comes the opportunity: go undercover as a spy in the French Resistance to help steal critical intelligence that could ultimately turn the tide of the war.\n\nDispatched behind enemy lines and in constant danger, Anna is filled with adrenaline, passion, and fear. She’s driven to make a difference―for her country and for herself. Whatever the risk, she’s willing to take it to help liberate France from the shadows of occupation and to free herself from the shadows of her former life.\n__________________________________________________\nPublishing on 4/1/21 ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n#bookstagram #ww2fiction #historicalfiction #strongwomen #booksandcoffee #bookaesthetic #amazonfirstreads #bookishflatlay #literature #bookphotography #booksof2021 #whattoreadnext #tbr #bookpic #booktography #bookblogger #picoftheday",

Thanks to @simonkids & @suzyapprovedbooktours for the opportunity to show you this amazing #middlegradebooks ! \n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nTwelve-year-old Jake’s life has just turned upside-down. His father was wounded in Afghanistan, and his mother is going to leave to care for him. That means Jake’s spending the summer on tiny Dewees Island with his grandmother. The island is a nature sanctuary—no cars or paved roads, no stores or restaurants. To make matters worse, Jake’s grandmother doesn’t believe in cable or the internet. Which means Jake has no cell phone, no video games...and no friends. This is going to be the worst summer ever!\n\nHe’s barely on the island before he befriends two other kids—Macon, another “summer kid,” and Lovie, know-it-all who lives there and shows both Jake and Macon the ropes of life on the island. All three are struggling with their own family issues and they quickly bond, going on adventures all over Dewees Island. Until one misadventure on an abandoned boat leads to community service. Their punishment? Mandatory duty on the Island Turtle Team. The kids must do a daily dawn patrol of the beach on the hunt for loggerhead sea turtle tracks. When a turtle nest is threatened by coyotes, the three friends must find a way to protect it. Can they save the turtle nest from predators? Can Jake’s growing love for the island and its inhabitants (be they two-legged, four-legged, feathered, or finned) help to heal his father?\n_______________________________________________\nThis comes out on June 15, 2021!

Yui struggles to continue on, alone with her pain. \nThen, one day she hears about a man who has an old disused telephone booth in his garden. There, those who have lost loved ones find the strength to speak to them and begin to come to terms with their grief. As news of the phone booth spreads, people travel to it from miles around. \nSoon Yui makes her own pilgrimage to the phone booth, too. But once there she cannot bring herself to speak into the receiver. Instead she finds Takeshi, a bereaved husband whose own daughter has stopped talking in the wake of her mother’s death. \nSimultaneously heartbreaking and heartwarming, The Phone Booth at the Edge of the World is the signpost pointing to the healing that can come after. \n________________________________________________\nPublishing on 3/9/21 , I already had this on my list, I hope you do too. Grief and loss and the prospect of healing have had profound affects on me. Any period of mental health battle has always been jumpstarted by losing someone close to me.

Trust me on this. \n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nKabul, 1978: The daughter of a prominent family, Sitara Zamani lives a privileged life in Afghanistan’s thriving cosmopolitan capital. The 1970s are a time of remarkable promise under the leadership of people like Sardar Daoud, Afghanistan’s progressive president, and Sitara’s beloved father, his right-hand man. But the ten-year-old Sitara’s world is shattered when communists stage a coup, assassinating the president and Sitara’s entire family. Only she survives. \n\nSmuggled out of the palace by a guard named Shair, Sitara finds her way to the home of a female American diplomat, who adopts her and raises her in America. In her new country, Sitara takes on a new name—Aryana Shepherd—and throws herself into her studies, eventually becoming a renowned surgeon. A survivor, Aryana has refused to look back, choosing instead to bury the trauma and devastating loss she endured. \n\nNew York, 2008: Forty years after that fatal night in Kabul, Aryana’s world is rocked again when an elderly patient appears in her examination room—a man she never expected to see again. It is Shair, the soldier who saved her, yet may have murdered her entire family. Seeing him awakens Aryana’s fury and desire for answers—and, perhaps, revenge. Realizing that she cannot go on without finding the truth, Aryana embarks on a quest that takes her back to Kabul—a battleground between the corrupt government and the fundamentalist Taliban—and through shadowy memories of the world she loved and lost. \n_____________________________________\nPublishing on 3/2/21 , you need to read this.

The Great War is over, the bounty of the land is plentiful, and America is on the brink of a new and optimistic era. But for Elsa Wolcott, deemed too old to marry in a time when marriage is a woman’s only option, the future seems bleak. Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life. With her reputation in ruin, there is only one respectable choice: marriage to a man she barely knows.\n\nBy 1934, the world has changed; millions are out of work and drought has devastated the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as crops fail and water dries up and the earth cracks open. Dust storms roll relentlessly across the plains. Everything on the Martinelli farm is dying, including Elsa’s tenuous marriage; each day is a desperate battle against nature and a fight to keep her children alive.\n\nIn this uncertain and perilous time, Elsa―like so many of her neighbors―must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or leave it behind and go west, to California, in search of a better life for her family.\n_______________________________________\nThis is out now and I hope you add it to your #tbr ! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #historicalfiction #booksandcoffee #cozyhome #dustbowl #thegreatdepression #bookish #readmorebooks #lit #booknerd #bookgeek #booklover #bookphotography #coverart #bookaesthetic #beautifulbooks #booksof2021 #fivestarreview #instadaily #instalove #bookblogger #picoftheday #whattoreadnext",

I’m always up for a fabulous #psychologicalthriller and this sounds right up my alley.\n.\n.\nBlurb:\n\nSkye Starling is overjoyed when her boyfriend, Burke Michaels, proposes after a whirlwind courtship. Though Skye seems to have the world at her fingertips―she’s smart, beautiful, and from a well-off family―she’s also battled crippling OCD ever since her mother’s death when she was eleven, and her romantic relationships have suffered as a result.\n\nBut now Burke―handsome, older, and more emotionally mature than any man she’s met before―says he wants her. Forever. Except, Burke isn’t who he claims to be. And interspersed letters to his therapist reveal the truth: he’s happily married, and using Skye for his own, deceptive ends.\n\nIn a third perspective, set thirty years earlier, a scrappy seventeen-year-old named Heather is determined to end things with Burke, a local bad boy, and make a better life for herself in New York City. But can her adolescent love stay firmly in her past―or will he find his way into her future?\n\nOn a collision course she doesn’t see coming, Skye throws herself into wedding planning, as Burke’s scheme grows ever more twisted. But of course, even the best laid plans can go astray. And just when you think you know where this story is going, you’ll discover that there’s more than one way to spin the truth.\n________________________________________\nThis one comes out 3/2/21 and I hope I’ve put it on your radar. I started a few pages and didn’t want to put it down.\n.\n.\n.\nSo how’s your Sunday? Mine?

There hasn’t been a @petermswanson book I haven’t liked yet, including his upcoming #EveryVowYouBreak . \n.\n.\nMini review: \nA page-turning, engaging thriller with some serious creepy vibes. An island getaway with forests, not sun, forests! A honeymoon with only two women at the resort. A recently married woman who has a secret and some major regret. Her new husband seems perfect.... \nWhat could go wrong??? Blahahaha right? \nEVERYTHING.\n4⭐️. \n.\n.\nI still love “Before She Knew Him”. I don’t know if I read it first but it stands out as my favorite Swanson. I really loved EPM too. The book references alone! \n.\n.\nAlso, we’re finally home! Power but no water, food, but not healthy food. Either way, we are so much luckier than so many so I’ll eat my canned tuna and be grateful. Also, no milk so that’s evaporated milk in my coffee. Surprisingly good. Or maybe I’m just desperate? Idk, bout to get a second cup. \nI hope everyone has a good weekend. Texas will be ok, my heart is hurting for everyone in horrible situations. Now is not the time to be politically divided or otherwise, and even if someone or some entity is held accountable for this debacle, it won’t help the people who are suffering right now. So let’s set everything aside and just be human. Help if you can, be grateful if you’re in a better situation. ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booksbooksbooks #peterswanson #mustread #readersgonnaread #booklover #booksandcoffee #thriller #thrillerbooks #bookstoread #bookaholic #goodreads #bookphotography #igreads #booksof2021 #lovetoread #readmorebooks #booksofinstagram #instamood #instapic #bookblog #picoftheday",

Maison Chanel has closed, thrusting haute couture dressmaker Lila de Laurent out of the world of high fashion as Nazi soldiers invade the streets and the City of Lights slips into darkness. Lila’s life is now a series of rations, brutal restrictions, and carefully controlled propaganda while Paris is cut off from the rest of the world. Yet in hidden corners of the city, the faithful pledge to resist. Lila is drawn to La Resistance and is soon using her skills as a dressmaker to infiltrate the Nazi elite. She takes their measurements and designs masterpieces, all while collecting secrets in the glamorous Hôtel Ritz—the heart of the Nazis’ Parisian headquarters.

But behind closed doors, she secretly forages for information from the underground resistance. Beneath her compliant façade lies a woman bent on uncovering the fate of her missing husband . . . but at what cost?

Do you remember Mick Rivas from Seven Husband’s?? \nWell apparently he had some kids. And this is about those kids in the 80’s. Grown up and having their own issues. I love the way it goes back and forth between the past and present. We get all that great back story from June, the kids mother (one of Micks many wives) and we get the kids past POV. The story opens on Nina, the eldest, and her marital woes. She throws a massive Malibu party every year, and her siblings Jay, Hud, and Kit are excited as always. \n.\n.\nI’m not sure where this is going but I’m loving it so much.

The past 24 hours have consisted of unprecedented snowfall, plunging temperatures, and power loss for much of San Antonio Tx. Earlier, we rushed a bit to the car so we could charge our devices and maybe get some internet. I grabbed the first book my hands found, I wanted something small so it wouldn’t be too heavy. I started it in the car and now I’m reading by firelight as we still don’t have power. I have to say, I’ll probably remember this book forever. It’s a good book, but also I’ll remember sitting in front of the fire with my son and my husband, just being. We’re doing our best to not be cold or hungry and this is really a night to remember. Books have always defined my life in some way. Tolkien always accompanied me to the beach in Cali. \n.\n.\nLove to all, and thank you to everyone who has sent me well wishes.

I chose @daniellegirardbooks newest book, “Far Gone” because of the setting. \nIt’s the second in her Badlands series, White Out being the first. \n.\n.\n.\nFar Gone Synopsis: \n\nWhen a North Dakota couple is shot down in their home in cold blood, the sleepy town of Hagen wakes with a jolt. After all, it’s usually such a peaceful place. But Detective Kylie Milliard knows better.\n\nDespite not handling a homicide investigation in years, Kylie is on the case. A drop of blood found at the scene at first blush promises to be her best evidence. But it ultimately only proves that someone else witnessed the murder—and the results are shocking: the DNA reveals a familial match to a crime involving local nurse Lily Baker from over a decade ago. This unveiling stirs new nightmares for Lily as she’s forced to reckon with the most traumatic time in her life.\n\nHaunted by their pasts and hunting the killer, Kylie and Lily uncover hellish secrets and impossible truths, finding answers that put both their lives in jeopardy.\n.\n.\nThis publishes on 7/6/21. I definitely recommend you add it to your list and grab “White Out” beforehand. It was a bestseller on most lists. Great thriller reads.

I really thought I was set, didn’t care much about what other people thought, don’t compare myself...., which is all true. But then I kept reading and this book teaches me to get out of my own way. To take care of me first so I can be a viable parent and human. Put my own oxygen on first so to speak.

I’d just finished Firefly Lane and I loved this book, especially after the tear-jerker that was. \n.\n.\nMy thoughts:\nFrom the first page I was absolutely hooked. And then when the three main characters were introduced, I was invested. \nSylvia is a little bit hard-nosed, but she had a difficult childhood that made her a bit of a survivor. She recently decided that motherhood is right for her. Now just to find the daddy lol. \nRiki is a teacher with a great boyfriend.... if only she could commit and stop having an insatiable crush on her married neighbor! \nEmbry is so sweet and devoted to her “trying to be an actor” husband Brandon. Only she has a secret that might rock their cute little world. \nThey all live in the same apartment building in L.A. , the owner having recently passed and leaving it to her swine of a son, Jonathan.\n.\n.\nI love that this book deals with real issues, but doesn’t take itself too seriously.

Brixton has no reason to suspect that the three incidents have anything in common, until he's contacted by Kendra Rendine, the Secret Service agent who headed up the vice president's security detail. Rendine is convinced the vice president was murdered and needs Brixton's investigative expertise to find out why.\n\nIn Israel, meanwhile, legendary anti-terrorist fighter Lia Ganz launches her own crusade against the perpetrators of that attack which nearly claimed the lives of her and granddaughter. Ganz's trail will ultimately take her to Washington where she joins forces with Brixton to uncover an impossible link between the deadly attack on Caesarea and the attempted Metro bombing, as well as the death of the vice president.\n\nThe connection lies in the highest corridors of power in Washington where a deadly plot with unimaginable consequences has been hatched. With the clock ticking toward doomsday, Brixton and Ganz race against time to save millions of American lives who will otherwise become collateral damage to a conspiracy destined to change the United States forever.\n_______________________________\nThis publishes on 2/16/21 and it sounds amazing! \nWhat’s the last fantastic, page turning thriller you read??\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookfeature #bookrecommendations #neutralstyle #thriller #mystery #bookphotography #thrillerbooks #tbr #igreads #readersofinstagram #bookblogger #instapic #picoftheday #whattoreadnext #booklover #bookpic #booksandcoffee",

I absolutely love rainbows so I couldn’t miss this one. \n.\n.\nWhy I love rainbows:\n🌈 My son is a #rainbowbaby , which in mom circle vernacular means, a baby born after the loss of another. One day, when Theodore is older, we will tell him about his big sister Ava (2/14/14). \n.\n.\n🌈 #lgbt , in our home, love is love. Nuff said.\n.\n.\n🌈THEY’RE JUST SO PRETTY!! One of my favorite memories is of a triple rainbow I saw up in the mountains somewhere in California. I was humbled by its sheer majesty. \n___________________________________\nI also want to mention my mug, which I got from @thejewelrybx and adore. I still remember Kamala taking on her opponent with such grace and class. #ImSpeaking , that’s all she needed to say. She didn’t put anyone down with low blows or vitriol, just, “I’m speaking”. I watched her take the oath with my five year-old son watching and felt such hope. \nShoutout to my niece for my beautiful rainbow heart painting! \n.\n\n.\n.\nHappy Sunday my friends, I can’t wait to see all of your rainbow stacks!

She mourned the death of her father and suffered a teen-life crisis, which delayed her university plans. But when her father’s will reveals a family-owned property in Northern England, Josie leaves London to find clarity at the secluded manor house. While exploring the estate, she discovers two-hundred-year-old love letters written by an elusive novelist, all addressed to someone named Josephine. And then she discovers a novel in which it seems like she’s the heroine…\n\n1820: Novelist Elias Roch loves a woman he can never be with. Born the bastard son to a nobleman and cast out from society, Elias seeks refuge in his mind with the quirky heroine who draws him into a fantasy world of scandal, betrayal, and unconditional love. Convinced she’s his soulmate, Elias writes letters to her, all of which divulge the tragedy and trials of his personal life.\n\nAs fiction blurs into reality, Josie and Elias must decide: How does one live if love can’t wait? Separated by two hundred years, they fight against time to find each other in a story of her, him, and the novel written by the man who loves her.\n______________________________\nOk so I love any book that brings in two really far apart time lines.

But her well-connected husband, Griffin―who is running for governor―is her prime suspect.\n\nJust before the attack, Claire was preparing for an exhibit of her shadow boxes, one of which clearly accuses Griffin of a violent crime committed twenty-five years ago. If the public were to find out who her husband is, his political career would be over. Claire’s certain her husband and his powerful supporters would kill her to stop the truth from getting out.\n\nWhen one of Claire’s acquaintances is murdered, the authorities suspect the homicide is linked to the attack on Claire. As the dual investigations unfold, Claire must decide how much she’s willing to lose to take down her husband and the corrupt group of elites who will do anything to protect Griffin’s interests and their own.\n____________________________________\nThis one is #8 on Amazon this week!

            "text": "☕️📖 Book Review ☕️📖\nThank you so much to @suzyapprovedbooktours , @patriciawalshchadwick & @posthillpress for my spot on the #LittleSister book tour. \n.\n.\nMy thoughts:\nPatricia grew up in a Catholic cult. Her memories support the cult getting more and more exclusive as cults do. She recounts how Father Leonard Feeny went from entertaining such Catholics as JFK, to falling from grace and being excommunicated from the Catholic Church. A devout group of followers, including Patricia’s parents, followed him into “orthodox Catholicism”, a group not recognized and in fact condemned by the Catholic Church. Their mantra was “No Salvation Outside the Catholic Church. \nMarriages were performed in secret, they built a compound the called The Center, with a red fence around it, and eventually husbands, wives, and children didnt cohabitate. The members were not allowed any information from outside their bubble. So when a 17 year old Patricia Walsh was kicked out of the faith and it’s walls, she was terrified. With absolutely nothing to go on, she had to build a life from nothing. And with determination, she did extremely well. \nWhat was interesting to me is how she perceived the devolution of the group as a child. How she noticed, slowly, people were robbed of their autonomy. They were made to shed their clothing in exchange for a black uniform of sorts. Father Feeney changed their names, separated husbands, wives, and their children. Father Feeney let his minion, Catherine Clarke wield an ugly fist of power and destruction. \nWhat really impressed me about this book is the power of forgiveness and that Patricia was able to fully embrace it and not live in perpetual anger. I have to give this 5 stars because it is a great story and quite fascinating as well. I highly recommend to those of you who love a good memoir and maybe who have an interest in the psychology of cults like I do. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookreview #review #bookphotography #nonfictionbooks #memoir #catholicchurch #cult #cultpsychology #bookish #bookstalove #photography #booksandcoffee #bookstoread #bookaddict #readersofinstagram #igreads #potd #bookblog #instalike #instalove",

A pioneer, one of the first black women to wear natural hair on screen, stunning in every thing I’ve ever seen her do.

I am so glad that #booksparks chose this as one of their #WRC2021 tour books. \n.\n.\n.\nFrom Cicely herself about the book:\n\"Just As I Am is my truth. It is me, plain and unvarnished, with the glitter and garland set aside. Here, I am indeed Cicely, the actress who has been blessed to grace the stage and screen for six decades. Yet I am also the church girl who once rarely spoke a word. I am the teenager who sought solace in the verses of the old hymn for which this book is named. I am a daughter and mother, a sister, and a friend. I am an observer of human nature and the dreamer of audacious dreams. I am a woman who has hurt as immeasurably as I have loved, a child of God divinely guided by His hand. And here in my ninth decade, I am a woman who, at long last, has something meaningful to say.” –Cicely Tyson\n_______________________________\nSo maybe you’re not a memoir person, I still urge you to grab this one because this woman made history.

But when Stanford alerts the school it's allotting only one spot to EBA for their incoming class, three mothers discover the competition is more cutthroat than they could have imagined.\n\nTech giant Alicia turns to her fortune and status to fight for her reluctant daughter's place at the top. Kelly, a Stanford alum, leverages her PTA influence and insider knowledge to bulldoze the path for her high-strung daughter. And Maren makes three: single, broke, and ill-equipped to battle the elite school community aligning to bring her superstar down.\n\nThat's when, days before applications are due, one of the girls suffers a near-fatal accident, one that doesn't appear to be an accident at all.\n\nAs the community spirals out of control, three women will have to decide what lines they're willing to cross to secure their daughters' futures...and keep buried the secrets that threaten to destroy far more than just college dreams.\n____________________________________\nPublishing on 2/2/21 , grab it! \nSo are you one of those parents that would do anything to get your kid into a prestigious school or program?\nI feel like we all want what’s best for our children but I’m definitely more the “community college unless you get a bad ass scholarship” parent🤷‍♀️. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#girlswithbrightfutures #booksparks #bookstagram #bibliophile #booklover #booksandcoffee #foodie #coffeetime #booksof2021 #booksofinstagram #igreads #lovetoread #readersgonnaread #whattoreadnext #cozymoments #tbr #ilovebooks #bookstagramfeature #instalike #instalove #bookblog #bookphotography #picoftheday",

So the world is stunned when the famous author is found dead on the beach from a self-inflicted gunshot -- the morning after her latest book hits the shelves. \n\nHer sister, Eileen, is at a loss. Clare led a charmed life: success, mansions, money…why would she throw it all away?

Suddenly, the life that Eileen had envied doesn’t seem so sparkling . . . \n.\n.\n.\nI love books where the mystery lies in the life of the dead person and there’s a story told from their secrets.\n.\n.\nOh my beautiful leaf!

It did not disappoint. \n.\n.\nAt 207 pages it is a fast read, and starts off with an ominous knock at the door. \nSarah Rock and her husband Eric live in Manhattan. Having been married for a while, things have gotten stale. She feels ignored and he’s probably cheating. \nWhen Sarah meets a handsome stranger in the park, he’s everything she’s been needing. “Lawrence” wants to keep mystery in their relationship, so he doesn’t even want to exchange last names. When Sarah’s regular therapist catches on to something different, Sarah lies. When someone ends up dead, lies come back to haunt. \n.\n.\nOk I did not see the major twists coming, I was engaged during this entire book. I don’t know what it is but I love domestic thrillers with cheating spouses. There’s always so many people to look at as potential antagonists. After reading this, I put Emile Zola’s “Therese Raquin” on my list to read.

Even though I was the kid who’d call my mom to pick me up from a slumber party, I romanticized the notion of boarding school. I’d imagine myself on some north eastern campus, fall foliage, staring out my dorm window, writing from an antique desk..... \n.\n.\nThis book isn’t that at all 😏.\n.\n.\nBook synopsis:\n\nCan we ever really escape our past?\n\nThe girls of St John the Divine, an elite English boarding school, were notorious for flipping their hair, harassing teachers, chasing boys, and chain-smoking cigarettes. They were fiercely loyal, sharp-tongued, and cuttingly humorous in the way that only teenage girls can be. For Josephine, now in her thirties, the years at St John were a lifetime ago. She hasn’t spoken to another Divine in fifteen years, not since the day the school shuttered its doors in disgrace.\n\nYet now Josephine inexplicably finds herself returning to her old stomping grounds. The visit provokes blurry recollections of those doomed final weeks that rocked the community. Ruminating on the past, Josephine becomes obsessed with her teenage identity and the forgotten girls of her one-time orbit. With each memory that resurfaces, she circles closer to the violent secret at the heart of the school’s scandal. But the more Josephine recalls, the further her life unravels, derailing not just her marriage and career, but her entire sense of self. \n____________________________________\nThis book is compulsively readable and you just keep turning pages. I opened it and sat there for a good half of an hour, just lost in the story. So grab it today, put it on your #tbr !\nI’ve never known anyone who’s gone to boarding school, have you?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #TheDivines #cozy #booksofig #igreads #readersofinstagram #bookphotography #flatlay #booksandcandles #williammorrow #readersofinstagram #bookish #bookishlove #booksof2021 #readmorebooks #whattoreadnext #booksandcoffee #latte #coverart #bookaesthetic #instalike #instalove #bibliophile #picoftheday",

She abandoned her marriage to join an ashram, and while Tara is busy as a partner to the ashram’s spiritual leader, Baba, little Antara is cared for by an older devotee, Kali Mata, an American who came to the ashram after a devastating loss. Tara also embarks on a stint as a beggar (mostly to spite her affluent parents) and spends years chasing a disheveled, homeless artist, all with young Antara in tow. But now Tara is forgetting things, and Antara is an adult––an artist and married––and must search for a way to make peace with a past that haunts her as she confronts the task of caring for a woman who never cared for her. \n\nSharp as a blade and laced with caustic wit, Burnt Sugar unpicks the slippery, choking cord of memory and myth that binds mother and daughter. Is Tara’s memory loss real? Are Antara’s memories fair? In vivid and visceral prose, Tibor Jones South Asia Prize–winning writer Avni Doshi tells a story, at once shocking and empathetic, about love and betrayal between a mother and a daughter. A journey into shifting memories, altering identities, and the subjective nature of truth, Burnt Sugar is a stunning and unforgettable debut.\n\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #burntsugar #booksandcoffee #bookish #booksharks #booksofinstagram #bookfeature #debutnovel #motherdaughter #readersofinstagram #igreads #booklover #booknerd #bookgeek #instablog #beautifulbooks #instalove #instalike #bookblogger #picoftheday",

It’s a day for coffee by the gallon. \nSo #TheMinders by @johnmarrs.author , thank you so much to @berkleypub & @netgalley for my copy to review. \nThis is absolutely in my top ten anticipated books of 2021. \n.\nI am a huge fan of John Marrs, his futuristic novels feel like episodes of Black Mirror. The perfect blend of a thrilling, nuanced plot, combined with a reckoning that technology has its limits. And as with anything, too much of it is definitely a bad thing. \nIn The Minders, countries are in danger of being hacked by an organization that wants their deepest, darkest secrets. The UK develops an initiative to store its security secrets within the minds of five humans. Humans can’t be hacked, they can be trained to be soldiers for the government. What could go wrong? Well humans are fallible and .... human. Fellow Marrs fans will be happy to know that plot elements from both “The Passengers” and “The One” make it into this book, weaving it into a fantastic semi-extension. But make no mistake, this is a stand-alone with the twists, turns and ultimate horror that you’d expect. \nThe Minders is available on 2/16/21 and I highly recommend adding it you your #tbr . \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #berkleypublishing #scifi #future #bookish #bookworm #booksofinstagram #igreads #johnmarrs #whattoreadnext #bookrecommendations #bookreview #bookblogger #readersofinstagram #booklover #thriller #thrillerbooks #bookphotography #flatlay #bookstalove #booksandcoffee #lattelove #picoftheday #lit #instalike",

Synopsis in comments. \n.\n\nMy thoughts: \nWoah this is a break-neck thriller! No pun intended. The author wastes absolutely no time getting into the story. The first few pages put you right into the middle of Margot and Nicks situation and doesn’t let up. The story alternates between Margot and Nick’s past starting from childhood. They each had fairly traumatic upbringings, in different ways, and it’s clear they have been shaped by their trauma. But they’ve also moved past it, surpassing their parents low expectations. The big twists I somewhat saw coming but that made it no less of a page turner. I really liked this book, I always appreciate a full backstory in any book. 4⭐️\n.\n.\nThank you to @suzyapprovedbooktours and @dacoauffenorde for my spot on this tour! \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #thriller #thrillerbooks #bookaddict #review #bookreview #booktour #booklover #booknerd #whattoreadnext #readersofinstagram #fortheloveofdogs #bookishlove #booksandcoffee #booklife #coverart #igreads #bookphotography #bookblog #instalike #instagood #picoftheday",

It’s heartbreaking, tragic and lovely. \n.\n. \nMary waits at the train station every day, holding a sign, “Come Home Jim”. It’s a curious sight but no one pays her any mind until she causes a bit of a ruckus and a young journalist, Alice, knows there’s a story there. What’s more is she connects with Mary on a personal level. She knows the pain of losing someone in the blink of an eye. She resolves to find Jim, to give Mary closure. \nThe story asks the questions, how much do we really know about anyone, how long can we hang on to love, how much do we choose to leave out when we look at our loved ones? \nI suppose this is a romance, it absolutely has that aspect. But more it’s a story of self-discovery and triumph over loss. It’s is an achingly beautiful book and I will read anything Abbie Greaves writes forevermore. \n#AnywhereForYou comes out on 4/6/21.

Most of the time I’d tell you that I love when a book is referenced in another book. If you’ve read this one, you’ll know of what I speak. However in this, I didn’t feel like I could love it. The characters felt a little one-dimensional to me, I didn’t like any of them. Albert Bitterman felt by far, the most fleshed out. I will say it’s a great thriller if you haven’t read one or are just getting into them. \nI know a lot of you loved it so I’m very much in the minority and that’s ok.

It’s fun and colorful and what we all need. \n.\n.\n#BeDazzled by @ry_la_sa \n@bookmarked \nSynopsis:\n\nRaffy has a passion for bedazzling. Not just bedazzling, but sewing, stitching, draping, pattern making―for creation. He's always chosen his art over everything―and everyone―else and is determined to make his mark at this year's biggest cosplay competition. If he can wow there, it could lead to sponsorship, then art school, and finally earning real respect for his work. There's only one small problem... Raffy's ex-boyfriend, Luca, is his main competition.\n\nRaffy tried to make it work with Luca. They almost made the perfect team last year after serendipitously meeting in the rhinestone aisle at the local craft store―or at least Raffy thought they did. But Luca's insecurities and Raffy's insistence on crafting perfection caused their relationship to crash and burn. Now, Raffy is after the perfect comeback, one that Luca can't ruin.\n\nBut when Raffy is forced to partner with Luca on his most ambitious build yet, he'll have to juggle unresolved feelings for the boy who broke his heart, and his own intense self-doubt, to get everything he's ever wanted: choosing his art, his way.\n—————————————————————-\nThis one comes out on 1/5/21 , it’s too cute, add it! \nTomorrow I’ll be posting my top ten of 2020.

I got this a few days before Christmas I think and I’m excited for it. \n.\n.\n#FayeFaraway by #HelenFisher:\n\n- Faye is a thirty-seven-year-old happily married mother of two young daughters. Every night, before she puts them to bed, she whispers to them: “You are good, you are kind, you are clever, you are funny.” She’s determined that they never doubt for a minute that their mother loves them unconditionally. After all, her own mother Jeanie had died when she was only seven years old and Faye has never gotten over that intense pain of losing her.\n\nBut one day, her life is turned upside down when she finds herself in 1977, the year before her mother died. Suddenly, she has the chance to reconnect with her long-lost mother, and even meets her own younger self, a little girl she can barely remember. Jeanie doesn’t recognize Faye as her daughter, of course, even though there is something eerily familiar about her...\n\nAs the two women become close friends, they share many secrets—but Faye is terrified of revealing the truth about her identity. Will it prevent her from returning to her own time and her beloved husband and daughters? What if she’s doomed to remain in the past forever? Faye knows that eventually she will have to choose between those she loves in the past and those she loves in the here and now, and that knowledge presents her with an impossible choice.\n—————————————————-\nThis one comes out on 1/26/21 so add it to your lists! I’m obsessed with the premise. I don’t live with regret at all, but some of the people most dear to me are gone. What I wouldn’t give to go back, even for a day. \n.\n.\nIf you could go back in time, for any reason, would you? \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #qotd #beautifulbooks #timetravel #latte #cozyhome #gallerybooks #booksofinstagram \n#booksof2021 #fantasy #igreads #toread #booksandcoffee #2021 #whattoreadnext #fortheloveofreading #bookaddict #readersofinstagram #booknerd #bookpic #bookphotography #instalike #instalove #picoftheday",

With a cuppa in my hand at all times. \n.\n.\nOk so #TheMidnightLibrary is such a fan favorite, you can’t see it but I have little pink sticky tabs all over my copy. Such poignant gems, @mattzhaig is no stranger to mental health issues and I loved it. I love his writing. So I bought #HowToStopTime ! @cozy.coffee.reads recommended it so I had to. I defer to the great donut goddess. \n.\n.\nI haven’t read Addie La Rue but this books premise has that vibe. Tom Hazzard has a rare condition that ages him very slowly, as in he looks 41 but has been alive for centuries. He has one rule, never fall in love. But alas, he breaks his own rule and must decide whether to stay stuck in the past or finally begin living in the present. \n.\n.\nThat’s all paraphrased but it sounds so good. I’m currently reading “Me Before You” and it’s the first thing that has really held all of my attention in a really long time. I don’t like romance all that much but I do like stories about the human condition. Love seems to be the common thread. The thing that saves us from being savage. \n.\n.\nAre you ready for Christmas??

The movie (Stand By Me) gave me one of the most poignant quotes: \n“I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?”. \n.\n.\nFor me it’s been true. My best friend Ryan is the best friend I’ll ever have. We were born four months apart, across the street from each other. He went a vastly different direction by the time we were teens and passed away when we were 24. But 12, 12 were our heydays. \n.\n.\nShawshank Redemption and Apt Pupil also came from this book.

The upstate New York  small town setting and Swanton Vermont are vivid. \nShana Merchant is still on leave after a traumatic kidnapping and torture at the hands of serial killer Blake Bram. In a few short days, Shana finds out her long lost uncle was in fact murdered twenty years before, and a child goes missing from a tourist spot while on a class trip. She knows they are related, Bram taunts her and follows her. In order to save a child, she must play Bram’s game and win in time. The past that she’s tried so hard to forget is her only key to figuring everything out.\n.\n.\nWow I loved this book.

She’s the mother of a precocious kindergartener, married to her soulmate—a loyal and loving police detective—and has a rewarding career as a doctor at the local hospital. \n\nBut everything comes crashing down when her son, Josh, is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. \n\nDetermined to save him, Emma makes the risky decision to sell opioids to fund the life-saving treatment he needs. But when somebody ends up dead, a lethal game of cat and mouse ensues, her own husband leading the chase. With her son’s life hanging in the balance, Emma is dragged into the dark world of drugs, lies, and murder. Will the truth catch up to her before she can save Josh? \n_______________________________\nThis premise!!! Alright.

Today is also my @suzyapprovedbooktours review so here it goes. \n.\n.\nMy thoughts:\nGreta is a little bristly, perhaps even unlikeable? But she’s ok with that. She prefers bugs to humans any day. While in the rainforest doing her PhD research, she gets word that her twin brother, Danny has had an aneurysm. So home she goes. Home is Midwest America, the last place Greta wants to be. But she loves her brother, not so much Meg his fiancé but that’s family right? Some you like, some you tolerate. \nGreta seems to push everyone away, including her mother, we also find out that she and Danny had a difficult upbringing. Greta feels guilty that she wasnt there when her dad died, her mom wasn’t there for them.\nGreta seems many things, one of them is redeemable. And this is just from my own personal experience, but from the start I wondered if she was on the Autism Spectrum. \nI absolutely loved the way this played out, loved how Greta became more than her eccentricities, there is such beauty in the writing. I love a unique protagonist.

Maybe that’s how good Pashley is at vivid description. \nWe get two points of view, that of seasoned detective Kateri Fisher, and that of Shannon Jenkins, a drop out teen who had to grow up far too quickly.\nSince this is the second in a series, we get a few references to Kateri’s past which I really enjoyed. I love seeing a well faceted, fleshed out character. \nShannon’s parts are heartbreaking. He’s almost metaphorically cut off at the legs before he even has a chance in the world. An addicted mother, a secret sister, and bills to pay. He meets a handsome stranger in the diner he works for and things finally seem to be turning around for him financially. \nUntil the day blood is found everywhere in the home he shares with his mother , and his secret sister is found hiding in a closet. The obvious culprit to everyone seems to be Shannon, but Kateri has a nose for depravity and she has a feeling they need to look further than the scared teenager in front of them.\nI really love how this one wrapped up and I’m hoping it’s not the last we see of Kateri.\n.\n.\n.\nThank you so much to @suzyapprovedbooktours for my spot on this tour!\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booktour #thriller #thrillerbooks #crimefiction #booknerd #whattoread #policeprocedural #bookaholic #read #coverart #booklover #bookblog #cozyvibes #christmasdecor #bookbabe #bookpic #bookphotography #booksofinstagram #igreads #lgbtbooks #instalike #instalove #picoftheday",

The country’s grandest example of privilege, it symbolizes the aspirations of its owner and the dreams of a girl, just as driven, who lives in its shadow.\n\nKerry MacGregor’s future is derailed when, after two years in college in New York City, family obligations call her home to the beautiful Appalachians. She is determined to distance herself from the opulence she sees rising in the Blue Ridge Mountains, however close its reach. Her family’s land is among the last pieces required to complete the Biltmore Estate. But something more powerful than an ambitious Vanderbilt heir could change Kerry’s fate as, one by one, more outsiders descend on the changing landscape—a fugitive from Sicily, a reporter chasing a groundbreaking story, a debutante tainted by scandal, and a conservationist prepared to put anyone at risk to stoke the resentment of the locals.\n\nAs Kerry finds herself caught in a war between wealth and poverty, innocence and corruption, she must navigate not only her own pride and desperation to survive but also the temptations of fortune and the men who control it. \n————————————————————\n\nHow’s that for some amazing #historicalfiction ?!

And this book is the one that most frequently comes to mind.\n.\n.\n“Dear Edward” by @annnapolitano is a masterpiece. A testament to the resilience of the human spirit even in the face of the greatest tragedy. \nThe story:\nTwelve-year Edward Adler is the sole survivor of a plane crash that kills his parents and 183 other passengers. \nHe is an absolute miracle, a media sensation. But Edwards heart died on that plane. He goes to live with his childless aunt and uncle, and befriends their neighbor, Shay. She’s about his age and for inexplicable reasons, the only human he feels safe around. He sleeps on her floor until it is deemed no longer proper. \n.\n.\nWhen Edward makes it to and surpasses the age his big brother was when he died, he has a bit of an existential crisis. \nSo many questions are posed in this book. How do you carry on after unimaginable loss, who are you without the people who define your existence....\n.\n.\nI cried so hard at this one. The epilogue is one of the best I’ve read. @pattyisbooked can tell you all the reasons this book is pure gold. I love how much she loves it. The passion she has for a book like this says so much about her spirit ❤️ .\n,\n.\n.\nHappy Saturday everyone! Feel free to post your thoughts about this book, or your favorite book this year! This is definitely my favorite of 2020.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#DearEdward #bookstagram #literaryfiction #booknerd #bookrecommendations #bookphotography #booksilove #toread #cozyvibes #bookpost #booklover #booklife #readersofinstagram #igreads #botm #photography #candlelight #fortheloveofreading #booksandcoffee #booksandcandles #instalike #instalove #bookbloggersofinstagram #picoftheday #lit",

It’s the second in her Shana Merchant series, but reads quite well as a stand-alone. \n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAfter leaving the NYPD following her abduction by serial killer Blake Bram, Shana Merchant hoped for a fresh start in the Thousand Islands of Upstate New York. Her former tormentor has other plans. Shana and Bram share more than just a hometown, and he won't let her forget it. When the decades-old skeleton of Shana's estranged uncle is uncovered, Bram issues a challenge: Return home to Vermont and solve the cold case, or the blood he spills next will be on her hands.\n\nAs Shana interviews members of her family and the community, mining for secrets that could help her solve her uncle's murder, she begins to realize how little she remembers of her childhood. And when Bram grows impatient and kidnaps again, leaving a trail of clues Shana alone can understand, she knows his new victim will only survive if she wins the psychopath's twisted game. In order to solve one mystery, Shana must wade into her murky past to unravel another. \n.\n.\n.\nAnd of course I added the first in the series “Death in the Family” to my list. \n.\n.\nSo what are you guys doing tonight? It’s #friyay but also our traditional Christmas movie night. We always start with Charlie Brown Christmas and then fight over the official kick off movie. I always want “A Christmas Story” but I’m legit the only one 😕. \nI hope everyone has a magnificent or at least peaceful evening my #booksta friends❤️. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booktour #thriller #berkleypublishing #tistheseason @berkleypub #thrillerbooks #crimefiction #cozy #lattelove #booksandcoffee #coffeelover #booklove #reader #igreads #bibliophile #bookbabe #bookphotography #bookpost #bookpic #ilovebooks #instalike #instalove #bookblogger #picoftheday",

The forensics and psychological profiling is intrinsic to understanding not only the killers brain, but the human brain. John Douglas was an innovator and a pioneer at a time when people couldn’t see the need for his research. \nAll of that being said, he and Mark Olshaker have a new book out! “The Killer’s Shadow” is one of my most anticipated reads this year. \n.\n.\nPartial synopsis:\n\nThe October 8, 1977 shooting was a forerunner to the tragedies and divisiveness that plague us today. John Douglas, the FBI’s pioneering, first full-time criminal profiler, hunted the shooter―a white supremacist named Joseph Paul Franklin, whose Nazi-inspired beliefs propelled a three-year reign of terror across the United States, targeting African Americans, Jews, and interracial couples. In addition, Franklin bombed the home of Jewish leader Morris Amitay, shot and paralyzed Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, and seriously wounded civil rights leader Vernon Jordan. The fugitive supported his murderous spree robbing banks in five states, from Georgia to Ohio. \n.\n.\nI feel like this couldn’t be more relevant. What we are experiencing today has deep, old roots. Thank you so much to @deystreet for my gifted copy of #KillersShadowBook . It will be imminently devoured. \n.\n.\n.\nI know this Thanksgiving looks a whole lot different from anything we’ve ever seen, but I urge everyone to be grateful for the good things. I’m extensively, fiercely grateful for my family of course. Particularly my sister who keeps teaching me what real grace and strength and love look like.

He learned it from Ninja Turtles🤣🤣🤣🤣. He is also on the Autism Spectrum. When he gets a bit overwhelmed he drops wherever he is and meditates. This means we’ve been in the middle of Target, restaurants, all kinds of places. But it seems to help him. He and I meditate before bed a lot of nights. Swipe to see him in action ➡️\n.\nThis book is so fabulous to teach these methods. “Your racing train of thoughts may try to take you down the railroad tracks, but you can stay in the Meditation Station , where children ages 4-8 learn how to calm their bodies and minds”. \n.\n.\nThere is a lot going on for kids these days, teaching them to focus and breathe and center themselves is so helpful. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#meditationstation #mindfulnessforkids #kidsbooks #momlife @anaitsart @shambhala_publications @penguinkids @penguinrandomhouse #bookstagram #bookstalove #meditation #parenting #booksforparents #booksforkids #bookstabuddies📚 #beautifulbooks #artofinstagram #bookcover #coverart #booklover #booksofig #instablogger #bookphotography #flatlay #instamood",

For the record, Ellery Adams is the bomb dizzle and then some. \n.\n. \nI don’t know exactly why but I love books about Instagram perfect people who aren’t perfect. Maybe because what you see on Instagram is rarely the whole, or even true story. And this book has it all.\n.\n.\n.\nSynopsis:\nFollowed by Millions, Watched by One\n\nTo her adoring fans, Emmy Jackson, aka @the_mamabare, is the honest “Instamum” who always tells it like it is. \n\nTo her skeptical husband, a washed-up novelist who knows just how creative Emmy can be with the truth, she is a breadwinning powerhouse chillingly brilliant at monetizing the intimate details of their family life.\n\nTo one of Emmy’s dangerously obsessive followers, she’s the woman that has everything—but deserves none of it. \n\nAs Emmy’s marriage begins to crack under the strain of her growing success and her moral compass veers wildly off course, the more vulnerable she becomes to a very real danger circling ever closer to her family.\n\nIn this deeply addictive tale of psychological suspense, Ellery Lloyd raises important questions about technology, social media celebrity, and the way we live today. Probing the dark side of influencer culture and the perils of parenting online, People Like Her explores our desperate need to be seen and the lengths we’ll go to be liked by strangers. It asks what—and who—we sacrifice when make our private lives public, and ultimately lose control of who we let in. . . .\n.\n.\n😱😱😱😱 I know right???

I wait for sales, use @thriftbooks , buy used on @amazon .... \nThis is the fruit of my recent labors. I’m determined to own everything @johnmarrs.author has written to now, he has a new book coming out and I’ll own that too. \n“Playing Nice” by @jpdelaney_ has been on my radar for so long and I am probably reading that next. Maybe. \n.\n.\n“Tightrope” is a searing sociological exploration of the demolition of the American dream. And what we can do to revive it. That is probably actually what I’ll read next. \n.\n.\n@lucindaberryauthor writes some awesome books and I had the pleasure of reading part of “The Best of Friends” on netgalley but I couldn’t finish. Reading digitally is almost painful for me. So I waited to grab a physical copy.\n.\n.\n“When all is Said” by @annegriffinwriter is recommended for people who love Ove. I’m all over that. \n.\n.\nSo happy Sunday! I’m going to have a book in one hand and my latte in the other until about an hour from now when our night begins.

So I went in apprehensive. Ready to not like it. I looked for reasons not to like it. But folks, I loved it. \n.\n.\nI loved the atmospheric, foreboding writing. There were some insightful gems, many quotes made it to my journal. \nAny book that starts in the 1980’s with a band of kids is my jam. As I started reading I thought a lot of “The Shadows”, down to the woods playing a pivotal role in the story. \nI’m also fond of a slow burn thriller. \nSomeone asked me if I liked the characters and I didn’t think about it until then, but no, I didn’t. And truthfully I like a story that doesn’t have likable characters. What I don’t like are wooden, flat characters. This book wasn’t that at all. It was uncomfortable in is rawness and honesty in fact. \nI disagreed that all 12 year old boys want to find a dead body, until I remembered there is an entire movie dedicated to that notion (Stand by Me, a story by Stephen King before it was a movie). \nMaybe the only beef I had with this book is that I wanted more.

Books can transport you anywhere, even other worlds. Which is my favorite thing to do. Go anywhere at the turn of a page. So here’s my stack:\n\nThe Martian- Might be lame, but I desperately want to go to space. Not necessarily be an astronaut or anything like that. Just the the solar system, feel something so big wrapping around you that you don’t have words that come close to what you feel. \n.\nThe Chronicles of Narnia- Narnia is and will always be my favorite place. I’ve been to Cair Paravel a thousand times, Aslan feels like a dear friend, the Dawn Treader is as vivid in my mind as the screen in front of me. Yes, Narnia is my favorite place. Fantasy lands count!\n.\nFreak- @jenniferhillierbooks always sets her books in the Pacific Northwest which is my favorite part of the USA. It’s speaks to my soul. I’m not at home in the sun, give me fog and tall trees any day. \n.\n.\nMe Before You- England, I love it. I love the culture, I love the history, I love the countryside. All of it. \n.\n.\nAnne Of Green Gables- Canada and PEI are stunning! My cousin spent a really long honeymoon in PEI and I’m still jealous 15 years later 🤣. \n.\n.\nThe Hobbit- Middle Earth. I really don’t need to say more. I had a dog named Shire and a cat named Arwen..... \n.\n.\n.\nSo there you have it, some of my favorite places that books take me. \nWhat would your stack look like?

I knew she was a contemporary of Virginia Woolf and I had read I tiny bit of her writing. \nWhat the author did with this story is take what we know and give it life. She gave Katherine a voice, and a personality with extensive research. \n.\n. \nI loved her spunk, and her bohemian lifestyle. I mostly resonated with her medical battle. She was determined to beat tuberculosis, going to several different doctors, and trying several experimental treatments, even slightly defying her husband’s opinions. \nIt is the mark of a fighter, to never give up. It saddened me that she so desperately wanted to join her friends in simple things outdoors. My heart broke for her a lot. Knowing that she only lived to be 34 was gut wrenching as I read. \nI am definitely going to read more of her writing. She was so talented. \n4⭐️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookreview #historicalfiction #booktour #readersofinstagram #booksandcoffee #bookaddict #bookaesthetic #bohodecor #bohemianstyle #cozy #bookish #bookstalove #bibliophile #lit #latte #booksandlattes #instagood #instabook #bookblogger #photography #picoftheday",

But Alexis wants to know everything. Start from the beginning, she says. The beginning? Can he really tell her about how he fled France during the French Revolution in 1789 or about Italy during World War II? If he tells her even a little, will she think of him as a liar or a freak rather than a lover?\n\nHe tries to deflect her probes, pleading shyness, but she knows that reticence is often the veil behind which secrecy lurks. His practice of stonewalling only further ignites her burning curiosity.\n\nAs the pressure for honesty mounts, he does what he’s always done—flee. But Alexis is not a lover to be easily dismissed. She follows him to Europe, determined to track him down for an explanation. Where can she start when her quarry doesn’t want to be found? Each clue she uncovers leads her deeper into intrigue.\n,\n.\n.\n.\nIf you’re down for a good mystery, with some time travel, this is your book.\n.\n. \nDo you like books with time travel? I do, I find it a really interesting element that adds rich layering to the plot. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #AnOddityofSomeConsequence #timetravel #mystery #romance #bookish #bookphotography #bookrecommendations #booksandcoffee #beautifulbooks #cozyvibes #booklover #photography #reading #bookblog #instadaily #instalove #tbrlist #picoftheday #coffeeandbooks",

You have to remember because Harvard doesn't let you forget. \n1969: the height of counterculture and the year universities would seek to curb the unruly spectacle of student protest; the winter that Harvard University would begin the tumultuous process of merging with Radcliffe, its all-female sister school; and the year that Jane Britton, an ambitious 23-year-old graduate student in Harvard's Anthropology Department and daughter of Radcliffe Vice President J. Boyd Britton, would be found bludgeoned to death in her Cambridge, Massachusetts apartment.\n\nForty years later, Becky Cooper a curious undergrad, will hear the first whispers of the story. In the first telling the body was nameless. The story was this: a Harvard student had had an affair with her professor, and the professor had murdered her in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology because she'd threatened to talk about the affair. Though the rumor proves false, the story that unfolds, one that Cooper will follow for ten years, is even more complex: a tale of gender inequality in academia, a 'cowboy culture' among empowered male elites, the silencing effect of institutions, and our compulsion to rewrite the stories of female victims. #wekeepthedeadclose #crime \n #truecrimecommunity #bookgiveaway #bookstagram #bookish #readersofinstagram #truestory #bookpic #bookaholic #igreads #booksof2020 #toread #booksofinstagram #fortheloveofreading #booklover #bookaesthetic #instalike #instafollow #picoftheday",

Thank you @htpbooks & @hanoversquarepress for my gifted copy of “Before the coffee gets cold” by Toshika Kawaguchi . I absolutely love the premise of this book, here’s a synopsis for you all:\n.\n.\n\nIf you could go back, who would you want to meet?\n\nIn a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a café that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee—the chance to travel back in time. \n\nOver the course of one summer, four customers visit the café in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn’t so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most important, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold. \n.\n.\n——————————————————————————————\nWhat ah introspective read. I cannot wait to delve in. \nSo what would you go back in time for? Who would you want to see?\nI would go back to any regular day at the breakfast table with my grandparents.

Thanks to @suzyapprovedbooktours , @crookedlanebooks & @jenniferpashley I have the perfect thing. #TheWatcher is out now! Review to come but here is the synopsis:\n- Pearl Jenkins is a nobody. She was a woman who lived as a hermit in the woods. One day, she's nowhere to be found, and all that's left behind is a pool of blood and a child no one knew existed, raised completely off the grid and in the grip of Pearl's manic paranoia. \n\nKateri Fisher is used to being an outsider. Now, she's the only female detective in the tiny upstate New York town of Spring Falls, where everyone knows everyone, but no one will talk. It's fitting that she takes the case that no one else wants. But as Kateri struggles to navigate the harsh rules of a new town while trying to learn the truth about the Jenkins family, only one thing becomes clear: neither she nor Pearl are as invisible as she first thought. Someone's always watching.\n.\n.\n😱😱😱👀👀👀👀 Yesss to this please and thank you. \nAlso, no matter what you’re doing this weekend, whether or not it’s Halloween related or you don’t observe it, from the bottom of my heart I wish you a beautiful weekend ❤️.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booktour #beautifulbooks #cozy #booksofinstagram #thriller #latte #booksandcoffee #bookphotography #igreads #tbr #booknerd #bookworm #readmorebooks #fortheloveofreading #bookstabuddies📚 #fallvibes #readersofinstagram #instalove #instafollow #bookblog #picoftheday",

Let me preface by saying that I am almost unable to read digitally, my eyes stay on a paragraph for so long, I have memory issues so flipping back to remember things is incredibly difficult....... and yet, my @amazonkindle ap tells me that I am 40% through this! It’s so engaging, thank you @stmartinspress @macmillanusa , @netgalley & @sallyhepworth for my gifted arc. \n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS: \n\nFrom the outside, everyone might think Fern and Rose are as close as twin sisters can be: Rose is the responsible one, with a home and a husband and a fierce desire to become a mother. Fern is the quirky one, the free spirit, the librarian who avoids social interaction and whom the world might just describe as truly odd. But the sisters are devoted to one another and Rose has always been Fern's protector from the time they were small. \n\nFern needed protecting because their mother was a true sociopath who hid her true nature from the world, and only Rose could see it. Fern always saw the good in everyone. Years ago, Fern did something very, very bad. And Rose has never told a soul. When Fern decides to help her sister achieve her heart's desire of having a baby, Rose realizes with growing horror that Fern might make choices that can only have a terrible outcome. What Rose doesn't realize is that Fern is growing more and more aware of the secrets Rose, herself, is keeping. And that their mother might have the last word after all.\n.\n.\nI love, love, love that Sensory Processing issues have been mentioned. It’s starting to be more recognized and that makes me so happy.  My son and I both have Sensory issues, and are both on the Spectrum.

So many times the fear of telling someone a hard truth lies in the fear that they will not act on it.\nAside from that, the authors bio states that she “writes thrillers for angry women”. \nCarly is an awkward freshman in college with anger built up. \nScarlett is a professor with an agenda: to make men pay for their misdeeds towards women — with their lives. \nThe story alternates between the two women and themes emerge: men thinking they can take what they want, be it a glance or a touch. \n\nReading through I felt rage. At all the memories I have of feeling objectified, unsafe, awkward because I was getting unwanted attention. We should be able to wear what we want without men looking at us like some fried chicken or some shit. My words, not from the book. I get the anger. This book is binge worthy. I could not put it down. A female serial killer who takes out pos men? \nYea I’m there for that. \n5 freakin’ ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💪🏻\n.\n.\nThank you so much to @scoutpressbooks & @laynefargo for my gifted copy❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#theyneverlearn \n#bookstagram #thriller #thrillerbooks #crimefiction #bookish #bookishlove #bookphotography #bookpost #readersofinstagram #bookreview #lit #bookaholic #whattoreadnext #fortheloveofreading #booktography #picoftheday #instablogger #bookstabuddies📚 #booksandcoffee #creepyvibes #instadaily #bookpic",

I feel like it’s flown under the radar and it really should be front and center. It’s satire at its finest. \nThank you so much to @hmhbooks & @bookishfirst for my gifted copy. It’s out on January 5, 2021 but you can already add it to your Amazon wishlist. \n.\n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nThere’s nothing like a black salesman on a mission.\nAn unambitious twenty-two-year-old, Darren lives in a Bed-Stuy brownstone with his mother, who wants nothing more than to see him live up to his potential as the valedictorian of Bronx Science. But Darren is content working at Starbucks in the lobby of a Midtown office building, hanging out with his girlfriend, Soraya, and eating his mother’s home-cooked meals. All that changes when a chance encounter with Rhett Daniels, the silver-tongued CEO of Sumwun, NYC’s hottest tech startup, results in an exclusive invitation for Darren to join an elite sales team on the thirty-sixth floor.\n\nAfter enduring a “hell week” of training, Darren, the only black person in the company, reimagines himself as “Buck,” a ruthless salesman unrecognizable to his friends and family. But when things turn tragic at home and Buck feels he’s hit rock bottom, he begins to hatch a plan to help young people of color infiltrate America’s sales force, setting off a chain of events that forever changes the game.\n\nBlack Buck is a hilarious, razor-sharp skewering of America’s workforce; it is a propulsive, crackling debut that explores ambition and race, and makes way for a necessary new vision of the American dream.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookcover #booksandcoffee #humor #lit #satire #bookaesthetic #ownvoices #bookstabuddies📚 #bookish #igreads #booksofinstagram #blackwriters #bookmail #flatlay #booksandplants #succulents #bookaholic #bookstalove #booklover #beautifulbooks #booktography #bibliophile #instadaily #instalove #picoftheday📷",

It’s the height of the Seattle dot-com boom, and he’s too busy cashing in his stock options to pay attention to his wife. He isn’t aware of Jeanie’s lingering shame and guilt, or that she married him in the desperate hope that devoting herself to marriage and motherhood would somehow absolve her from the sins in her past.\n\nTheir hidden agendas collide when Greg discovers evidence of Jeanie’s long-ago pregnancy. As she confesses the details of that drunken night with her married professor, Greg’s pristine image of her is blown. His shock deepens into violent fury, and Jeanie realizes she needs to leave him—but Greg won’t let her go. He’s up for a big promotion, and he’s not about to let her ruin his reputation by walking out on him. He’ll resort to blackmail if necessary. Or worse. \n.\n.\n.\nWOW, this book.

Thank you so much to @stmartinspress for my #gifted copy. \nThe premise grabs me for a few personal reasons. It’s set in 1934 Texas, my grandma would have been 12. She grew up on a farm in South Texas. I don’t have much to go on but her stories of that time are etched in my mind. They grew everything they ate, life was modest but gratitude abundant. I love Kristin Hannah’s ability to transport you to times and places and I can’t wait to delve into this beautiful story! \n.\n.\nHere’s the synopsis: \n\nTexas, 1934. Millions are out of work and a drought has broken the Great Plains. Farmers are fighting to keep their land and their livelihoods as the crops are failing, the water is drying up, and dust threatens to bury them all. One of the darkest periods of the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl era, has arrived with a vengeance. \n\nIn this uncertain and dangerous time, Elsa Martinelli—like so many of her neighbors—must make an agonizing choice: fight for the land she loves or go west, to California, in search of a better life. The Four Winds is an indelible portrait of America and the American Dream, as seen through the eyes of one indomitable woman whose courage and sacrifice will come to define a generation. \nScheduled to release on 2/9/21. You won’t want to miss this one.

Thank you to @girlfridayproductions for my copy! \n.\n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nFBI bomb tech Paul Grale isn’t a computer expert, but he knows trouble when he sees it. Independence Base, a new top-secret military facility north of Las Vegas, houses a breakthrough artificial intelligence that has US enemies worried and on the move. Threat chatter is already way up when a known terrorist bomber—and Grale’s archnemesis—slips past border security. Then two of Independence Base’s star computer coders go missing. Were they kidnapped as part of a terror plot? Or did they quit in protest, taking their vast knowledge of the potentially dangerous AI code with them?\n\nSpecial Agent Grale still grapples with the injuries sustained clearing IEDs in Iraq years ago. He’s managed the pain with exercise and over-the-counter drugs for years, but it’s getting worse. People at the office are beginning to talk. When he’s accused by a crooked pharmacist of illicit use of painkillers, he finds himself isolated and facing an uncertain future. Possibly, the end of his career. But first, Grale must push through the pain long enough to thwart an attack . . . as a terror team waits for the right moment to strike.\n.\n.\nOut now, add it to your #tbr !\n.\n.\n\n.\n#bookstagram #GFP #NoHesitationThriller #KirkRussell #thriller #thrillerbooks #bookphotography #whattoreadnext #bookphoto #bookaesthetic #booksandcoffee #coverart #bookstabuddies📚 #bibliophile #cozyhome #instabook #instafollow #booklover #readersofinstagram #booksta #readmorebooks #girlfridayproductions #partner",

During the summers, while her mother worked days in a local motel and danced most nights in the Provincetown bars, her babysitter—the kind, handsome handyman at the motel where her mother worked—took her and her sister on adventures in his truck. He bought them popsicles and together, they visited his “secret garden” in the Truro woods. To Liza, he was one of the few kind and understanding adults in her life. Everyone thought he was just a “great guy.” \n\nBut there was one thing she didn’t know; their babysitter was a serial killer. \n\nSome of his victims were buried—in pieces—right there, in his garden in the woods. Though Tony Costa’s gruesome case made screaming headlines in 1969 and beyond, Liza never made the connection between her friendly babysitter and the infamous killer of numerous women, including four in Massachusetts, until decades later. \n\nHaunted by nightmares and horrified by what she learned, Liza became obsessed with the case. Now, she and cowriter Jennifer Jordan reveal the chilling and unforgettable true story of a charming but brutal psychopath through the eyes of a young girl who once called him her \nfriend.\n.\n.\nWoah was my reaction when I read the blurb.

Possibly because I identified with so much of it, but it touches on such relatable topics, I feel like anyone might. \nLiz loses her husband Thomas, a pastor, within the first few pages. I like that it jumps right into her journey. Right during the loathsome knitting circle that Liz leads and can’t stand. She’s a pastors wife, but we find out that her choices were never simple. And that she’s dying to break free.\nWhen Thomas dies, it’s her chance. \nShe joins a theater group through her friend (eventually bestie Val), meets her kinda crush Lance there, and starts to really live. \nShe also realizes just how much under Thomas’s thumb she was. Which leads her to realize that their grown daughter, Abigail, was completely controlled by Thomas as well. \nAbigail tries to control Liz but Liz is never going back. \nAnd then gasp, a pregnancy out of wedlock.\n\nMmkay, I hated Thomas for the entire book, and didn’t like Abigail until the last few pages. I think I audibly uttered “back the fuck off” at least once.\n\nBut I have met women like Liz , especially in the church (certainly not trying to put down organized religion here) , so I recognized her self doubt and the realizations she had. \nThere was such immense beauty in her journey, I cried. I was rooting for her and felt for her. I think it’s been a while since I connected to a character this much. \nI couldn’t put this down, and loved the entire story. 5⭐️\n.\n.\nThank you to @tlcbooktours & @lmunley for my #gifted copy of this book to review ❤️. \n.\n\n#bookstagram #latte #aborrowedlife #tlcbooktours #booksandcoffee #bookaesthetic #bookreview #romance #womensfiction #bibliophile #beautifulbooks #bookstalove #tbr #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #succulents #cozy #aesthetic #bookstabuddies📚 #igreads #bookblog #instastyle #instafollow #picoftheday #booksilove",

ID is by far my most watched channel. \nThis one is out on March 9, 2021 but you can add it to your list on Amazon. Cause I had it there when I opened my #bookmail 😂. \n.\n.\nJoe Kenda is such a badass. That’s why I used my Badass Bookworm bookmark from @sarcastic_reader_shop . It fits. \nSo the book synopsis: \n\nThe most common triggers for homicide are fear, rage, revenge, money, lust, and, more rarely, sheer madness. This isn’t an exact science, of course. Any given murder can have multiple triggers. Sex and revenge seem to be common partners in crime. Rage, money, and revenge make for a dangerous trifecta of triggers, as well.\n\nThis book offers my memories of homicide cases that I investigated or oversaw. In each case, I examine the trigger that led to death. I chose this theme for the book because even though the why of a murder case may not be critical in an investigation, it can sometimes lead us to the killer.\n\nAnd even if we solve a case without knowing the trigger, the why still intrigues us, disrupting our dreams and lingering in our minds, perhaps because each of us fears the demons that lie within our own psyche—the triggers waiting to be pulled.\n.\n.\n.\nDefinitely reading ASAP. How is everyone this gloomy Wednesday? It’s gloomy here and that’s my favorite kind of day for reading. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booksandcoffee #joekenda #homicidehunter #killertriggers @investigationdiscovery #crime #crimebooks #truecrimebooks #bookish #readersofinstagram #igreads #booksofinstagram #cozy #coffeetime #bookstabuddies📚 #bookphotography #nonfiction #booklover #booksilove #tbr #amreading  #bookporn #instadaily #instafollow #bookblog #picoftheday",

I loved every second of it. \nMolly Clarke is driving home from her sons school on a deserted country road during a storm. \nHer family has fallen apart since the death of her 9 year old daughter five years prior.\nMolly thinks everyone’s life would be better off without her, so when she runs out of gas, her thoughts of deserting her life are strong in her mind.\n\nWhen her family is finally notified that her abandoned car and a note are found, everyone is certain that she left and doesn’t want to be found.\n\nHer daughter Nicole feels it in her bones that something is off. That her mother would never leave them. So she sets off to find answers in the small, tight lipped town of Hastings. Her brother Evan makes her swear to find their mother. Nicole promises.\n\nWhat ensues is soooo twisted and deliciously meandering. I thought I had things figured out a few times, but like any good thriller, I was proven wrong. Brilliant writing and a wonderful story. Absolutely one of my favorite thrillers of 2020. Thank you so much to @stmartinspress and Wendy Walker for my copy to review. \n.\n,\n.\nGo grab this!!!

I don’t like comparing books but within the first few pages I’m getting Eleanor Oliphant vibes and I love it! Not to mention, this cover art is everything.\nPublisher: @alcovepress \nAuthor: @kbairokeeffe \nPublication Date: November 10, 2020\n\n.\n.\n. \nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAgatha Arch's life shatters when she discovers her husband in their backyard shed, in flagrante delicto, giving the local dog walker some heavy petting. Suddenly, Agatha finds herself face to face with everything that frightens her...and that's a loooooong list.\n\nAgatha keeps those she loves close. Everyone else, she keeps as far away as possible. So she's a mystery to nearly everyone in her New England town. To her husband, she's a saucy, no-B.S. writer. To her Facebook Moms group, she's a provocateur. To her neighbor, she's a standoffish pain in the butt. To her sons, she's chocolate pudding with marshmallows. And to her shrink, she's a bundle of nerves on the brink of a cataclysmic implosion.\n\nDefying her abundant assortment of anxieties, Agatha dons her \"spy pants\"--a pair of khakis whose many pockets she crams with binoculars, fishing line, scissors, flashlight, a Leatherman Super Tool 300 EOD, candy, and other espionage essentials--and sets out to spy on her husband and the dog walker. Along the way, she finds another intriguing target to follow: a mysterious young woman who's panhandling on the busiest street in town.\n\nIt's all a bit much for timorous Agatha. But with the help of her Bear Grylls bobblehead, a trio of goats, and a dog named Balderdash, Agatha may just find the courage to build a better life.\n.\n.\nAdd this quirky gem to your #tbr ❤️❤️❤️❤️\n,\n.\n.\n.\n#booktour #bookstagram #bookstalove #cozyhome #bookaholic #bookaddict #booknerd #coverart #bookaesthetic #booksandplants #succulents #photography #bookstabuddies📚 #bookish #quirky #bookbabe #picoftheday #booktography #reading #beautifulbooks #whattoreadnext #bookblogger #instastyle",

You need to read this sweet debut🤍. \n☕️\n☕️\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAllison James is a people pleaser and rule follower, but the day before her thirty-fifth birthday, that all backfires: she is unexpectedly fired from the public relations firm she’s worked at for twelve years, only to come home and find out that her fiancé has been sleeping with her maid of honor.\n\nFeeling lost, Allison takes her friend Jordan’s advice and uses the time off for some self-reflection. Over the next few months, she devours countless self-help books (albeit skeptically), schedules a soul reading with an astrologer/psychic/magician, and goes on a meditation retreat in Costa Rica, where she finally starts to feel like she’s getting her groove back.\n\nBack at home, her desire to escape the condo she once shared with her fiancé makes her a regular at the new coffeehouse in her neighborhood, where she finds some guidance from (and eye candy in) the attractive owner, Eric. Between Jordan’s support, the Barnes & Noble self-help aisle, and the Tao of Eric, Allison gradually discovers that her old life wasn’t as perfect as she thought—and that if she truly wants to find her happily-ever-after, she’s going to have to start writing her own rules. \n☕️\n☕️\nI’m only a few pages in and let me tell you, I’ve had a dark week personally.

A powerful memoir about childhood abuse and resolving to not let it break you. \n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAs a little girl, Teressa’s father dotes on her and little sister, Karen, while mercilessly mocking her older sister, Debbie. Teressa thinks its Debbie’s fault―until she gets a little older and he begins tormenting her, too. Soon enough, his verbal abuse turns physical. Her sergeant father brings his military life home, meeting each of his daughters’ infractions with extreme punishment for them all. Meanwhile, their mother watches silently, never defending her daughters and never subjected to physical abuse herself. Terrified to be at home and terrified to tell anyone, Teressa seeks solace in books, music, and the family she can find outside of her home: a best friend, a kind neighbor, and a doting grandfather. At first cowed by her father’s abuse and desperate to believe that maybe, one day, things will change, Teressa ultimately grows into a young woman who understands that if she wants a better life, she’ll have to build it for herself―so she does. \n.\n.\n.\nOn a personal note, I have to say, being in an abusive household changes you in ways that aren’t predictable.

Their lives are just getting back to normal, and Jack and Taylor have settled into married life with their young son, Evan. The man who’d threatened their lives—Damon Crosse, is dead, and his evil plan for society thwarted.\n\nBut soon a series of bizarre murder/suicides capture Jack’s attention. When he begins to piece together the seemingly unrelated incidents, a disturbing pattern emerges. Could someone be intentionally causing people to become homicidal? Meanwhile, Taylor is producing a story about a class action suit against a national insurance company that has reached the Supreme Court. As Jack and Taylor uncover layer after layer, they start to suspect that their stories are connected and that there is something darker and more insidious at play.\n\nWhen they make the shocking discovery that Crosse actually faked his own death, and is very much alive, Jack and Taylor must race against the clock to try and find him before he executes his new plan to take back control and destroy not only their lives,  but the future of the country. \n.\n.\nI definitely am going to order the first one #TheNetwork . \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#jacklogan #harperpaperbacks #bookstagram #bookphotography #thriller #crimefiction #booktour #bookish #booksofinstagram #lit #goodreads #bookobsessed #igreads #bookstalove #photography #bookstabuddies📚 #booksandcoffee #reader #instagood #instablog #bookstagrammer #picoftheday",

It's a mystery to twenty-six-year-old Margot, until she visits her childhood apartment in Koreatown, LA, and finds that her mother has suspiciously died. The discovery sends Margot digging through the past, unraveling the tenuous invisible strings that held together her single mother's life as a Korean War orphan and an undocumented immigrant, only to realize how little she truly knew about her mother.\n\nInterwoven with Margot's present-day search is Mina's story of her first year in Los Angeles as she navigates the promises and perils of the American myth of reinvention. While she's barely earning a living by stocking shelves at a Korean grocery store, the last thing Mina ever expects is to fall in love. But that love story sets in motion a series of events that have consequences for years to come, leading up to the truth of what happened the night of her death.\n\nTold through the intimate lens of a mother and daughter who have struggled all their lives to understand each other, The Last Story of Mina Lee is a powerful and exquisitely woven debut novel that explores identity, family, secrets, and what it truly means to belong. \n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booktour #amreading #bookphotography #booklover #beautifulbooks #ownvoices #coverart #cozyvibes #booksof2020 #bookaesthetic #booksandcoffee #readersofinstagram #igreads #bookish #bookstabuddies📚 #fortheloveofbooks #instagood #instafollow #picoftheday #bookblogger",

A deceitful American father and a naïve decision by a Filipino mother transformed their lives forever. \nValorie, Veronica, Vance, and Vincent’s perfect world turned into a nightmare one hot afternoon in 1959 in Cebu, Philippines. What was to be a quick lunch with their father turned into a flight to America, where four dreadfully long years of running from state to state, hiding, and vanishing into the night followed. Kidnapped from the only world they knew, confusion quickly set in. At nine, Valorie, the eldest, liked seeing their father after his absence for over a year. Vance, a timid six-year-old, went along with whatever Valorie did. Vincent, the baby at three, cried for his mother while clinging to Veronica for comfort. Veronica, eight, was the only one who was truly panicked by what was happening around them—and she recognized instantly that she and her siblings would have to stick together in order to survive. In that moment, her childhood ended and the warrior within her emerged. \n\nMoving from state to state and school to school, avoiding the law, looking over their shoulders at every turn, the four Slaughter children found themselves fighting not only the heartbreak of separation from their loving mother but also poverty, discrimination, and abuse. Their only weapons were their deep love for one another and an unwavering determination to survive the trials they faced—and find their way back to their mother. \n——————————————————\nI find most memoirs to be so powerful in that the author is basically bleeding on to the page. I’m always inspired and prodded to write my own but when I read memoirs like this one I feel like my story pales in comparison.\nIf you wrote your own memoir, what would it be called?\n.\n.\n\n#bookish #bookstagram #nonfiction #booklover #photography #booksofinstagram #bookpic #bookaesthetic #booksandcoffee #reading #cozyhome #bookstalove #bookstabuddies📚 #lit #inspo #booknerd #bookworm #bookaholic #instadaily",

Alright, this is one memoir I want to delve into. \n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAt age forty, with two growing children and a new consulting company she’d recently founded, Gretchen Cherington, daughter of Pulitzer Prize–winning poet Richard Eberhart, faced a dilemma: Should she protect her parents’ well-crafted family myths while continuing to silence her own voice? Or was it time to challenge those myths and speak her truth—even the unbearable truth that her generous and kind father had sexually violated her?\n\nIn this powerful memoir, aided by her father’s extensive archives at Dartmouth College and interviews with some of her father’s best friends, Cherington candidly and courageously retraces her past to make sense of her father and herself. From the women’s movement of the ’60s and the back-to-the-land movement of the ’70s to Cherington’s consulting work through three decades with powerful executives to her eventual decision to speak publicly in the formative months of #MeToo, Poetic License is one woman’s story of speaking truth in a world where, too often, men still call the shots. \n.\n.\n.\nTriggers: sexual abuse, psychological abuse.\nWhat a powerful story.

It’s a wonderful piece of Historical Fiction spanning the 1870’s through the early 1900’s. Set in Fall River, Massachusetts, the largest textile manufacturer in the US at the time, the story follows three immigrant families and their dreams of America being a better life. But “better” becomes not so clear anymore, life in a round the clock mill isn’t really living. Simply subsisting isn’t happiness. Child labor laws... nonexistent.\n.\n.\n.\nThis seems like such a beautiful, important book.

This years events have caused a much needed movement. It has at times caused me so much anger and despair, I’ve had to divorce myself from watching or reading things for a bit. It’s not as though I don’t have a background regarding Black History, I do. If you ask my momma, it has angered me since I was old enough to realize that there was a damn problem. \nBut I’m an intense and emotional person, so I find that I with newfound eyes, I’ve had to digest things slowly or I become profoundly depressed. \nWhatever rate you have to go at, that’s fine, don’t let people make you feel like you’re not doing enough. Everyone is different and at different places in their journey. Just don’t stop. Keep those eyes open. Only then can we change the hideous trajectory we’ve been on. \nI realize this was probably poorly worded and I may get under a few peoples skin, but I don’t have any ill intentions. On the contrary, I’m so heartbroken and disillusioned that I’ve had to pace myself. \nAll of that being said, love each other, be kind.

But what Alex finds in their empty cottage points him toward a different reality:\n\nHis wife has always carried a secret. And now she's disappeared.\n\nIn his hunt for the truth, Alex comes across Layla, a young woman with information to share, who may hold the key to everything his wife has kept hidden. A girl without a clear recollection of her own past. A strange, quiet girl whose memories may break them all.\n\nTo find his wife, Alex must face what Layla has forgotten.

What she didn't plan on? Ronan Knight and his old-school sports bar next door opening on the very same day. He may be super swoony, but Blaire hasn't spent years obsessing over buttercream and bourbon to have him ruin her chance at success.\n\nFrom axe throwing (his place) to frosting contests (hers), Blaire and Ronan are constantly trying to one-up each other in a battle to win new customers. But with every clash, there's also an undeniable chemistry. When an even bigger threat to their business comes to town, they're forced to call a temporary time-out on their own war and work together. And the more time Blaire spends getting to know the real Ronan, the more she wonders if it's possible to have her cupcake and eat it too.\n.\n.\n.\nThe cover alone! Add this to your #tbr if you haven’t already❤️. \nIn addition to her new book, @booksparks sent me #MeetCute and #GoodLuckCharm plus a few themed goodies. This was a fun box to unpack. \n.\nWhat’s your favorite #romcom movie?? Mine well, mine is #WhenHarryMetSally . I never watched it until I met my husband and it became “our” movie. Sickly sweet and cliche, I know. Still, life isn’t a movie and the man is a low-key hoarder who leaves his socks everywhere👀.....\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #romanticcomedybooks #romance #romcom #beautifulbooks #bookaholic #cake #bookporn #cupcakes #booksandcoffee #booksparks #bookpost #readersofinstagram #igreads #photography #bookphotography #bookaesthetic #fortheloveofreading #love #instagood #instafollow #bookblogger #picoftheday",

But nothing so far has come close to evoking the feels that this book did. Even the happy, sweet moments made me tear up because it was all so poignant in the context of the story. I remember weeping after I closed this one, and picking up my sleeping son. \n.\n.\n😂 made me laugh: #OneToWatch had such funny, witty moments (Chris Evans), and I really did laugh audibly. Such a cute read.\n.\n.\n\n😡made me angry: #TheVanishingHalf , racists piss me off. Nuff said. \n.\n.\n🤷‍♀️couldn’t finish: #GreenRiverRunningRed : I fully intend on finishing this one. And I read little bits every now and then. It’s good, but not fast paced by any means. \n.\n.\n👁changed my mind: #TheGreatBelievers was everything. But I grew up thinking the Reagan era was the bomb-dizzle. However, as an adult I realize that the gay/HIV crisis was treated egregiously.

I started reading but then stopped because there’s a reason I don’t read digitally. I have memory issues so I find myself flipping back and forth in a book frequently. I know, write things down. But there’s no way to know what I’ll forget so there’s no real point or advantage to that. \nAll this to say, I stopped reading because within the first 20 pages, this book is just so good. \n.\n.\nIt is based on the real Des Moines paperboy kidnappings in the early 1980’s. \nI’ll put the synopsis in comments.\nThis one is out on August 11. It’s a really good read so far and I can’t wait to get my hands on a physical copy. \n.\n.\nThere is a documentary called “Who Took Johnny” about Johhny Gosch, I’ve watched it over and over. \nKidnapping is something I’ve been obsessed with since I was 10, and a girl my own age, Heidi Seeman was abducted in my hometown. My own daddy, hard nosed as he was, wept the day her body was found. \nThat case was when I knew that bad things can happen. It also forged my love for true crime. \n.\n.\nThis book merges both, so naturally I fervently sought it. \nThanks again Kali. \n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #forthethrillofbooks #thriller #crimefiction #booksandcoffee #aesthetic #amreading #bookaesthetic #coverart #coffeelover #cozyhome #bookstabuddies📚 #photography #bookphotography #booktography #booklover #fortheloveofreading #booksofinstagram #bookpost #instalike #instadaily #instafollow #picoftheday @crookedlanebooks",

I was legitimately upset that I needed to put this one down last night to go to sleep. \nFrom the very first few pages you are sucked into Molly’s world of sadness, grief, introspective inner monologue. And that’s the first chapter! \nMolly disappears on a dark stormy night. There is a note found in a local motel is apologetic and tells her family not to look for her.\nHer daughter Nicole knows this isn’t her moms style. Knows that she’d never leave them willingly. It’s up to her to prove what no one else believes. \nThis is proving to be one of my favorite thrillers, it doesn’t let up in that genre, but it has heart, it’s a family drama too. \nThis one is set to publish on September 15. Put on on your #tbr , thank me later. This is my first Wendy Walker book but by far not my last. \n\n.\n.\nThank you to @stmartinspress & @wendywalkerauthor for this gifted copy ❤️\n.\nAlso, thank you to anyone who watched our live video last night or since.

There are many characters, multiple POV switching, extremely detail oriented. I can only imagine that comes from Hanks background in investigative reporting.\nThere are so many layered lies interwoven through each other, as the story unfolded my shoulders let go of their tension. Because I was on the edge of my seat reading this, trying to guess where it was headed. \nThere’s also the present and the past to contend with in dissecting this story, and it all hinges on taking down Pharminex, a drug company complicit in death and sterility for women. \nMonifan is supposed to be a miracle drug for women suffering from fertility issues, the use of it for such is off label though. For many women it proves to be a nightmare, robbing them of the chance to ever have children. \nThe Vanderwald family owns Pharminex and isn’t going to let their fortune go so easily. \n\nThere’s a reporter, her assistant, a lawyer, a woman posing as a pharmacy rep.... but which one is the liar?\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n.\n.\n.\nLooooved this one so much.

I love that you can vaguely see the steam coming off of my coffee cup. \n.\n.\nLast night I was so exhausted and just responding to my son on autopilot mode.\nHe asks, “what’s wrong momma?”\nI say, “Momma’s just a little sad”.\n.\n. \nWhen he asked why, I perked up, aware that I need to tread lightly. I’m the mom, I need to be on my game.\n.\n.\n“No reason baby, sometimes you just get sad.”\n.\n.\n“Is it because of Aunt Margie?”\n.\n.\nWow guys, kids really do pay attention to everything. The previous night he had a memory of my aunts home. Which led to a conversation about death and cancer. And he picked up on the fact that his Auntie Phia has cancer. The fear in his eyes was palpable. I held my breath before speaking. \n.\n.\nThese are such difficult conversations but I don’t believe in shielding my son from everything, nor can I. We are realizing that he picks up even on our unspoken moments. So I’m honest with him. Sensitive, but honest. \nParenting is hard and it’s not a one-size fits all thing. \nDo your best and give yourself grace.

Though the first book is delightful I hear. \nThis story really is magical, quite literally! Marnie is a matchmaker and sees sparkles around her matches. If that sounds not believable, it’s written in the most sincere way, there isn’t anything campy about it. \nMarnie has a big question to ask her longtime boyfriend Patrick. \nShe wants them to have a baby.\nPatrick, for reasons of his own, isn’t on the same page. \nIn comes Fritzie......\nFritzie is the product of a one night stand from Patrick’s past. Her mother basically leaves her at the doorstep. \nMarnie is sweetness and love incarnate because she takes this little girl as if she’s her own. \n\nPatrick isn’t so sure about any of it. I began to get really annoyed with him, I didn’t think he deserved Marnie. \nAnd at a point, she decides the same. \nI would rather not give too much away, because this is a completely charming story. But what I will say is that I had tears in my eyes and then went into the ugly cry at the end. \nOn a personal note: I absolutely love the way @maddiedaws puts adoption in such a beautiful light. I have fertility issues and so do my sisters. Adoption is an amazing thing and I love when it’s handled so wonderfully in literature. \n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booksofinstagram #igreads #beautifulbooks #coverart #magicalrealism #bookish #booksandcandles #bookaesthetic #bookishlove #booktography #booknerd #reader #tbr #whattoreadnext #bookstabuddies📚 #love #romance #picoftheday #bibliophile #bookbabes #instagood #bookblogger #lifestyle #lit #chicklit",

I cannot thank @atriabooks , @simonandschuster & @lisajewelluk enough for my #gifted copy of Invisible Girl.\nThis is by far my most anticipated and sought after book this year. I will be out of commission today lol. .\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nLONDON: On a fine avenue of grand houses, big cars and electronic gates, lies a neglected urban wasteland\n\nIt is nearly midnight, and very cold. Yet in this dark place of long grass and tall trees where cats hunt and foxes shriek, a girl is waiting... When Saffyre Maddox was ten something terrible happened and she's carried the pain of it around with her ever since. The man who she thought was going to heal her didn't, and now she hides from him, invisible in the shadows, learning his secrets; secrets she could use to blow his safe, cosy world apart.\n\nOwen Pick is invisible too. He's thirty-three years old and he's never had a girlfriend, he's never even had a friend. Nobody sees him. Nobody cares about him.\n\nBut when Saffyre Maddox disappears from opposite his house on Valentine's night, suddenly the whole world is looking at him. Accusing him. Holding him responsible.\n\nBecause he's just the type, isn't he?

After the five tour books I am set to read, this will be my next. It is short, but by all accounts, pure genius. Crime fiction at its finest. @sophiamarie425 let’s have this one read by the next unboxing! .\n.\nIf nothing else folks, look up Agatha Christie herself. Her personal life is wrought with delicious scandal and mystery. .\n.\n**A Plea if you will:\nIf you are in Texas or one of the many states that are seeing rises in Covid, please stay home if and when you can, wear a mask in public. Wash your hands. My sister just finished chemotherapy. This virus isn’t political, we have let it divide us which is something I have trouble fathoming. It’s not a hoax. Some people get mild symptoms, and some need hospitalization. And some die.\nEven a cloth mask when worn by everyone gives a measurable level of protection. My baby sister just waged a war on a vicious fkin cancer, and I cannot stand the thought of her getting sick because people have the right not to wear a mask, a right to congregate.....\nIt’s not about rights at this point, it’s about the collective good.

But when her best friend, Summer, invites her on a glamorous getaway to the Mediterranean aboard her billionaire boyfriend's yacht, the only sensible answer is yes. Belle hopes the trip will be a much-needed break from her stalled acting career and uniquely humiliating waitressing job, but once she's aboard the luxurious Lion's Den, it soon becomes clear this jet-setting holiday is not as advertised.\n\nBelle's dream vacation quickly devolves into a nightmare as she and the handful of other girls Summer invited are treated more like prisoners than guests by their controlling host-and in one terrifying moment, Belle comes to see Summer for who she truly is: a vicious gold digger who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. \nBelle realizes she's going to have to keep her wits about her -- and her own big secret closely hidden -- if she wants to make it off the yacht alive. —————PUB DATE JUNE 30th———— .\n.\n.\n.\n#giveaway #bookgiveaway #bookstagram #bookcover #tbr #summerreads #thriller #bookaesthetic #beautifulbooks #bookstalove #tbr #bookish #booklover #bookstabuddies📚 #lit #booksofinstagram #readmore #booktography #bookaholic #bookblogger #instagood #picoftheday #whattoreadnext #booknerd",

But for Ruby, it’s a devastating loss that leaves her on her own with her violent father. While she receives many condolences, her best friend, Layla, is the only one who understands how this puts Ruby in jeopardy.\n\nTheir closeness is tested when Layla’s father, the pastor of their church, demands that Layla stay away. But what is the price for turning a blind eye? In a relentless quest to save Ruby, Layla uncovers the murky loyalties and dangerous secrets that have bound their families together for generations. Only by facing this legacy of trauma head-on will Ruby be able to break free.\n\nAn unforgettable debut novel, Saving Ruby King is a powerful testament that history doesn’t determine the present and the bonds of friendship can forever shape the future. .\n.\n.\nWe are all trying to diversify our reading and this is perfect.

I’ve ordered so many books during the pandemic I really won’t ever catch up with my #tbr shelves. .\n.\n.\nSynopsis:\n\nIn 1992, a car accident kills a young man and forever changes the lives of three people… Now, twenty years later, they’ll all come to regret the choices they made that day, as the secrets and lies they’ve told to protect each other become the very things that tear their lives apart.\n\nAfter a night of fun, Abby was responsible for the car crash that killed her beloved brother. It is a sin she can never forgive herself for, so she pushes away the man she loves most, knowing that he would eventually hate her for what she’s done, the same way she hates herself.\n\nTwenty years later, Abby’s husband, Nate, is also living with a deep sense of guilt. He was the driver who first came upon the scene of Abby’s accident, the man who pulled her to safety before the car erupted in flames, the man who could not save her brother in time. It’s this guilt, this regret that binds them together. They understand each other. Or so Nate believes.\n\nIn a strange twist of fate, Liam (her old lover—possibly her true soulmate) moves in with his own family next door, releasing a flood of memories that Abby has been trying to keep buried all these years. Abby and Liam, in a complicit agreement, pretend never to have met, yet cannot resist the pull of the past—nor the repercussions of the dark secrets they’ve both been carrying… .\n.\n.\nHave you read this one? It sounds so good, I’ve wanted it for a while. .\n.\nMy sister and I had a chill Monday. Coffee and cookies.

Thank you so much to @blackstonepublishing & @emily_a_adrian for my #gifted copy of #everythingisundercontrol ❤️❤️❤️\n.\n.\nThis has been on my radar, it sounds so poignant and beautiful and I cannot wait to read it. .\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAmanda is a new mother, and she is breaking. After a fight with her partner, she puts the baby in the car and drives from Queens to her hometown in rural Ohio, where she shows up unannounced on the doorstep of her estranged childhood best friend. Amanda thought that she had left Carrie firmly in the past. After their friendship ended, their lives diverged radically: Carrie had a baby the summer after high school, became a successful tattoo artist, and never escaped Ohio s conservative grid of close-cut grass. But the trauma of childbirth and shock of motherhood compel Amanda to go back to the beginning and to trace the tangled roots of friendship and family in her own life.\n\nCompelling and engaging, Everything Here Is under Control is a raw, honest, occasionally hilarious portrait of the complexity, conflicting emotions, and physical trauma of both modern motherhood and the intense, intimate friendships that women forge in their youth.\n.\n.\n.\nSo much yes, you guys will want to read this.\nIt publishes on July 28, add it to your lists!

But we all know that it never ends there. Because, of course, one lie leads to another…\n\nGrowing up, Jane and Marnie shared everything. They knew the other’s deep-est secrets. They wouldn’t have had it any other way. But when Marnie falls in love, things begin to change.\n\nBecause Jane has a secret: she loathes Marnie’s wealthy, priggish husband. So when Marnie asks if she likes him, Jane tells her first lie. After all, even best friends keep some things to themselves. If she had been honest, then perhaps her best friend’s husband might still be alive today…\n\nFor, of course, it’s not the last lie. In fact, it’s only the beginning…\n\nSeven Lies is Jane’s confession of the truth—her truth. Compelling, sophisticated, chilling, it’s a seductive, hypnotic page-turner about the tangled, toxic friendships between women, the dark underbelly of obsession and what we stand to lose in the name of love. .\n.\n.\nHas this been on your radar?

She'll become a remarkable woman, an icon of her century, but that's a long way off.\n\nNot my fault, she thinks, dropping a bloody crowbar in the irrigation ditch after Daddy. She steals Momma’s Ford and escapes to Depression-era San Francisco, where she fakes her way into work as a newspaper copy boy.\n\nEverything’s looking up. She’s climbing the ladder at the paper, winning validation, skill, and connections with the artists and thinkers of her day. But then Daddy reappears on the paper’s front page, his arm around a girl who’s just been beaten into a coma one block from Jane’s newspaper―hit in the head with a crowbar.\n\nJane’s got to find Daddy before he finds her, and before everyone else finds her out. She’s got to protect her invented identity. This is what she thinks she wants. It’s definitely what her dead brother wants. .\n.\nPUB DATE: 6/23/2020\n.\n.\nI know there is a lot going on in the country right now, I myself am heartbroken. A man’s near to last words calling for his momma, well that’s something I can’t bear. My heart is with his momma and his whole family right now. Please join me in thinking about a family who lost their loved one. Peace and love to you all❤️.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booklover #historicalfiction #bookish #whattoreadnext #tbr #bookaddict #readmorebooks #fortheloveofreading #bookaesthetic #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #booksandcoffee #igreads #bookworm #instadaily #instagood #bookblogger #picoftheday #bookpic #bookphotography",

When she gets to the floor, she sees it’s none other than her close friend Jess, with her ten month old, Betsey. What’s more, the story that Jess is providing isn’t adding up.\nLiz is faced with the difficult choice to be a Dr. first and report the injury to authorities, or give her friend the benefit of the doubt.\nIt takes a good deal of thought but she rightfully decides to report the incident which sets a process in motion that exposes Jess and her family as not quite as perfect as they seem.\n.\n.\n.\nMy thoughts:\nThe story was really well written, though I found less thriller and more domestic drama. I got a feel for the characters and was absolutely able to connect with them. I’m a mother so I don’t know if that’s why, but I think I saw a little of myself in Liz and Jess. Jess is the “perfect” mom, we all know one. We also know that perfection doesn’t exist and there are obviously issues that brings up. \nThis book dealt with mental illness so well, some might find it raw but there’s nothing tame about mental illness. Bravo for that, we need to have those conversations, we need to normalize mental illness and postpartum mental health. Add this one you guys, and make it a book club read. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nAvailable 8/18/20\n.\nPS.... I want to thank @pepperidgefarm for providing my family with delicious cookies because I’m no Jess.\n..\n.\n.\n\n#bookstagram #booksandcoffee #bookreview #thriller #crimefiction #momlife #emilybestlerbooks #chocolatechipcookies #bookish #igreads #lit #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #readersofinstagram #bookcover #aesthetic #booklover #whattoreadnext #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #booknerd #instablog #booked #booklife #hygge",

It’s the sequel to the extremely popular “Matchmaking for Beginners”.\n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nMarnie MacGraw and Patrick Delaney have been in love for a few years now, enough to realize that they are imperfectly perfect together. Still, there are some things that maybe need a little attention. Marnie’s ebullient; he’s brooding. She thrives on change; he prefers stability. She sees marriage and parenthood in their future, but he can’t see beyond the shadow of an earlier tragedy.\n\nThen an eight-year-old surprise from Patrick’s past shows up on their doorstep, cartwheeling into their lives and spinning things in all directions. While it’s not exactly the change she envisioned, it looks like instant family to Marnie. But Patrick, afraid of being hurt again, retreats further into himself. Suddenly, two very different pieces of a beautiful puzzle find it harder and harder to fit. How can Marnie trust in the magic of the universe when it seems to be doing its best to knock her off her feet?\n\nBut some love stories are worth waiting for. And what’s love without a little chaos anyway? .\n.\n.\nTea today folks, I ate waaaaayyy too much of my sisters pasta bake yesterday and my system just says no at this point. @mlouuuise , best pesto pasta EVER!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookpic #beautifulbooks #bookaesthetic #booksandtea #teatime #bookphotography #romance #tbrpile #whattoreadnext #bookstalove #booklover #cozy #bibliophile #readersofinstagram #igreads #matchmakingforbeginners #fortheloveofreading #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #instalike #instadaily #bookblogger #booklife #photography",

Thank you to @tlcbooktours @carmenboullosabook &\n@coffeehousepress for my #gifted copy of “The Book of Anna”. A very interesting piece of historical fiction and a gorgeous cover.\n.\n.\n.\nBOOK SYNOPSIS:\n\nSaint Petersburg, 1905. Behind the gates of the Karenin Palace, Sergei, son of Anna Karenina, meets Tolstoy in his dreams and finds reminders of his mother everywhere: the vivid portrait that the tsar intends to acquire and the opium-infused manuscripts Anna wrote just before her death, which open a trapdoor to a wild feminist fairy tale. Across the city, Clementine, an anarchist seamstress, and Father Gapon, the charismatic leader of the proletariat, plan protests that embroil the downstairs members of the Karenin household in their plots and tip the country ever closer to revolution. Boullosa tells a polyphonic and subversive tale of the Russian revolution through the lens of Tolstoy's most beloved work. .\n.\nDo you like historical fiction? I love it.

It was perfectly twisted and suspenseful.\nI kept screaming in my head “GET A LIFE JOANNA!” . Piper never seemed particularly anything to me except a little bit selfish.

Is the place really haunted by evil forces, as her father claimed?\nWhat was it like? Living in that house.\nMaggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a nonfiction book called House of Horrors. His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling The Amityville Horror in popularity—and skepticism.\nToday, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father’s book. But she also doesn’t believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don’t exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after her father’s death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but warm. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself—a place filled with relics from another era that hint at a history of dark deeds. As Maggie experiences strange occurrences straight out of her father’s book, she starts to believe that what he wrote was more fact than fiction. ———————————————————-\nPUB DATE: June 30, 2020\n.\n.\nYou have to put this on your list guys✔️✔️✔️✔️\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bookaddict #thriller #whattoreadnext #bookaesthetic #booksandcoffee #tbr #booknerd #booktography #bookphotography #igreads #fortheloveofbooks #booksbooksbooks #bookish #booked #booklover #bookstabuddies📚 #photography #bookblogger #instadaily #hygge #picoftheday #raedunn #readersofinstagram",

Another book by #johnglatt . \nI ordered this book immediately after getting the arc of “The Perfect Father”. .\n.\nI think very few of us need any introduction to the Cleveland abductions and subsequent fall out, but also triumph of three brave women. But I’ll provide a blurb from @goodreads all the same. —————————————————— The Lost Girls tells the truly amazing story of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, who were kidnapped, imprisoned, and repeatedly raped and beaten in a Cleveland house for over a decade by Ariel Castro, and their amazing escape in May 2013, which made headlines all over the world. The book has an exclusive interview and photographs of Ariel Castro's secret fiancé, who spent many romantic nights in his house of horror, without realizing he had bound and chained captives just a few feet away. There are also revealing interviews with several Castro family members, musician friends and several neighbors who witnessed the dramatic rescue. ———————————————————- I’ll never say that this is an easy genre to read. But I will say that the depths the human mind can go, the harm it can afflict is horrifying and at the same time, fascinating.\nI find myself pondering, was this person born this way or were they created.... nature vs. nurture and such.\nAnd there is ample evidence to support nurture (or lack thereof ), however, I do think some people are born missing whatever chip that makes us human.\n.\n.\nI don’t want to bring y’all down though!

She strikes up a conversation with a beautiful stranger in the next seat, and their connection is fast and easy. The woman introduces herself as Martha and confesses that she’s been stuck in an affair with her boss. Selena, in turn, confesses that she suspects her husband is sleeping with the nanny. When the train arrives at Selena’s station, the two women part ways, presumably never to meet again.\n\nBut days later, Selena’s nanny disappears.\n\nSoon Selena finds her once-perfect life upended. As she is pulled into the mystery of the missing nanny, and as the fractures in her marriage grow deeper, Selena begins to wonder, who was Martha really?

Well I just made it a thing.\n.\n.\nThanks so much to @stmartinspress & @netgalley this gifted copy of “The Perfect Father” by John Glatt. .\n.\nIf you don’t know the story of Chris Watts and his heinous crimes, this book has it all and then some. I’ve watched a lot of documentaries and tv footage of the horrors, but John Glatt gives a ton of background into both Chris and Shannan. He fills in the story so that you get a more complete perspective of how everything played out and began.\n.\n. \nNotice that this is true crime, it is trigger city. Murder being the billboard of trigger warnings. I’m only half-way through and I’m really liking the way the author had put a really well known story together with some interesting background. \nI think I am drawn to the true crime genre because it is a reminder that there is a facet of humanity so dark and depraved that we really can’t let our guard down. That doesn’t mean living in fear, but it does mean to live and exist mindfully and cautiously.\n.\n.\nThis book has an expected Pub Date of July 21, 2020. .\n.\nDo you read any true crime?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#bookstagram #theperfectfather #americanmurder #booksandcoffee #crime #truecrime #chriswatts #ebook #thriller #whattoreadnext #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #bookaesthetic #arc #booktography #bookaholic #tbr #booknerd #bookstabuddies📚  #cozy #hygge #readersofinstagram #booksofig #bookblogger #instagood #photography #picoftheday #booklife",

Alex and Jeannine form a bond as they find ways to cope with Angel's absence.\n\nThe swim team and members of a struggling community come together in search of the missing teen-will they manage to figure out where she has gone and track Angel down alive?\n.\n.\nPUB DATE: 5/5/2020\n.\n.\n.\nAdd this to your #tbr ! \nI have so much to read but I opened this one and couldn’t stop reading . \nFun fact: whenever I get a new book, I compulsively read the first page.\nDo you have any weird book compulsions?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#watermark \n#booksharks #booksparks #bookstagram #booklover #bookaesthetic #booksandcoffee #fortheloveofreading #whattoreadnext #bookstalove #booktography #igreads #readersofig #reader #cozy #hygge #photography #booknerd #booksofinstagram #bookrecommendations #thriller #bookstabuddies📚 #instagood #instabook #bookblogger #booklife",

She can write anything. \nSynopsis:\n\nMeet the residents of the London brownstone on 31 Almanac Road who together weave a tangled web of romance. Ralph, a ne'er-do-well artist, suddenly realizes he's head over heels in love with his new flatmate Jem, the most fun and sensible girl he's ever encountered. Unfortunately, Ralph's best friend, Smith, has already won Jem's affections, although Smith has not entirely given up his passion for the femme fatale, Cheri, who lives upstairs. Across the hall, Karl and Siobhan have been happily unmarried for years, until Karl gets a smashing job as a London rush-hour DJ and momentarily gets tempted into Cheri's cozy lair. .\n.\n.\nI can’t wait to grab the sequel, which admittedly is a bit difficult to find. .\n.\nHope you are all ok, I know current events are a bit scary.

Notice I didn’t say romance, tough it has a bit of that, but it’s a love story. A story about marriage and relationships, the good, the bad and the ugly.\n.\n.\n.\nIt’s divided into two parts “Her Silence”, and “His Silence”. In the first part we see that Maggie has overdosed on sleeping pills and Frank never leaves her side in the hospital. Maggie’s in a coma and a kind nurse tells Frank to talk to her.\nSo he does. Pensively at first but then it flows. And we hear their love story from his point of view starting from day one all the way to the present. They’ve been married 40 years.\nFrank has stopped talking in the present after a traumatic event. Which in the very beginning I thought meant he was a distant husband, a cold man.\nThrough his story we see the opposite.\nWhat a love story! If ever a man loved a woman the way Frank loves Maggie! #goals ...\n.\n.\n.\nIn His Silence, we are told Maggie’s side through a series of letters Frank finds. \nOn her end we learn that her infertility and overwhelming desire to have children gets in the way of her happiness and by extension, their marital happiness.\n.\n.\nI’ll save the rest for you to read my friends. This is absolutely one of my favorite books this year. It’s a quiet, moving, powerful book. \nThanks again to @tlcbooktours , @abbiegreavesauthor & @williammorrowbooks for the opportunity to review this one. .\n.\n.\n.\n#thesilenttreatment \n#bookstagram #booksandcoffee #bibliophile #cozy #bookphotography #igreads #whattoreadnext #tbr #bookworm #goodreads #booklover #reader #goodreads #igreads #booktography #booktour #fortheloveofreading #photography #bookaesthetic #love #bookstalove #bookish #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #bookblogger #hygge #cozy #instagood",

But for the past six months, they have not spoken. Not a sentence, not a single word. Maggie isn’t sure what, exactly, provoked Frank’s silence, though she has a few ideas.\n\nDay after day, they have eaten meals together and slept in the same bed in an increasingly uncomfortable silence that has become, for Maggie, deafening.\n\nThen Frank finds Maggie collapsed in the kitchen, unconscious, an empty package of sleeping pills on the table. Rushed to the hospital, she is placed in a medically induced coma while the doctors assess the damage.\n\nIf she regains consciousness, Maggie may never be the same. Though he is overwhelmed at the thought of losing his wife, will Frank be able to find his voice once again—and explain his withdrawal—or is it too late? .\n.\n.\nTO ENTER GIVEAWAY:\n✨Must be following me (stick around ;)\n✨Tag a friend or twenty!

When she meets Leo Drakos, a handsome, successful lawyer, the wedding ring on his finger is the only thing she doesn’t like about him. Yet as Piper well knows, no marriage is permanent.\n\nMeanwhile, Joanna has been waiting patiently for Leo, the charismatic man she fell in love with all those years ago, to re-emerge from the severe depression that has engulfed him. Though she’s thankful when Leo returns to his charming, energetic self, paying attention again to Evie and Stelli, the children they both love beyond measure, Joanna is shocked to discover that it’s not her loving support that’s sparked his renewed happiness—it’s something else.\nPiper. Leo has fallen head over heels for the flaky, New Age-y newcomer, and unrepentant and resolute, he’s more than willing to leave Joanna behind, along with everything they’ve built. Of course, he assures her, she can still see the children.\n\nJoanna is devastated—and determined to find something, anything, to use against this woman who has stolen her life and her true love. As she digs deeper into Piper’s past, Joanna begins to unearth disturbing secrets . . . but when she confides to her therapist that she fears for the lives of her ex-husband and children, her concerns are dismissed as paranoia. Can she find the proof she needs in time to save them? .\nPUB DATE: 5/20/2020\nAdd this to your list!!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#booksandcoffee #booktour #bookstagram #bookaesthetic #booklover #booktography #bookcover #bookish #igreads #whattoreadnext #bookstalove #bookpic #reading #hygge #cozy #booklover #bookaddict #lit #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #thriller #instabook #bookblogger #picoftheday  #photography #instagood #lifestyle",

And its a genre a bit outside of my comfort zone so I’m thrilled to read it! I haven’t delved much until fantasy outside of LOTR so it’s high time I do!\n.\n.\n.\n. \nBOOK SYNOPSIS:\n\nAs children, Goldie, Liyana, Scarlet, and Bea dreamed of a strange otherworld: a nightscape of mists and fog, perpetually falling leaves and hungry ivy, lit by an unwavering moon. Here, in this shadowland of Everwhere, the four girls, half-sisters connected by blood and magic, began to nurture their elemental powers together. But at thirteen, the sisters were ripped from Everwhere and separated. Now, five years later, they search for one another and yearn to rediscover their unique and supernatural strengths. Goldie (earth) manipulates plants and gives life. Liyana (water) controls rivers and rain. Scarlet (fire) has electricity at her fingertips. Bea (air) can fly.\n\nTo realize their full potential, the blood sisters must return to the land of their childhood dreams. But Everwhere can only be accessed through certain gates at 3:33 A.M. on the night of a new moon. As Goldie, Liyana, Scarlet, and Bea are beset with the challenges of their earthly lives, they must prepare for a battle that lies ahead. On their eighteenth birthday, they will be subjected to a gladiatorial fight with their father’s soldiers. If they survive, they will face their father who will let them live only if they turn dark. Which would be fair, if only the sisters knew what was coming.\n\nSo, they have thirty-three days to discover who they truly are and what they can truly do, before they must fight to save themselves and those they love.\n\nThis one is out on March 31, 2020! .\n.\n.\n.\n#thesistersgrimm #fantasy #beautifulbooks #bookaesthetic #booksandcoffee #bookstagram #bookaholic #booktography #bookishlove #photography #bibliophile #booknerd #reading #currentlyreading #igreads #booksofig #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #instabook #bookblogger #picoftheday #cozy #hygge",

I’m reading my first e-book on @netgalley ! \nThanks so much to @atriabooks & @simonandschuster for sending me this copy, I’ve desperately wanted to read this for a while.\n.\n.\nBOOK SYNOPSIS:  When Fern Douglas sees the news about Astrid Sullivan, a thirty-four-year-old missing woman from Maine, she is positive that she knows her. Fern’s husband is sure it’s because of Astrid’s famous kidnapping—and equally famous return—twenty years ago, but Fern has no memory of that, even though it happened an hour outside her New Hampshire hometown. And when Astrid appears in Fern’s recurring nightmare, one in which a girl reaches out to her, pleading, Fern fears that it’s not a dream at all, but a memory.\n\nBack home in New Hampshire, Fern purchases a copy of Astrid’s recently published memoir—which may have provoked her original kidnapper to abduct her again—and as she reads through its chapters and visits the people and places within it, she discovers more evidence that she has an unsettling connection to the missing woman. As Fern’s search becomes increasingly desperate, she hopes to remember her past so she can save Astrid in the present…before it’s too late.\n.\n.

She was a pool girl at his country club. Their affair should have been a summer fling. But it meant everything to Tabitha.\n\nYears later, Connor comes back into Tabitha's life—older, richer, and desperately unhappy. He married for money, a wealthy, neurotic, controlling woman whom he never loved. He has always loved Tabitha.\n\nWhen Connor’s wife Nina takes her own life, he’s free. He can finally be with Tabitha. Nina’s home, Windswept, can be theirs. It seems to be a perfect ending to a fairy tale romance that began so many years ago. But then, Tabitha finds a diary. \"I’m writing this to raise an alarm in the event of my untimely death,\" it begins. “If I die unexpectedly, it was foul play, and Connor was behind it. Connor—and her.” Who is Connor Ford? Why did he marry Nina? Is Tabitha his true love, or a convenient affair? As the police investigate Nina’s death, is she a convenient suspect?\n\nAs Tabitha is drawn deeper into the dark glamour of a life she is ill-prepared for, it becomes clear to her that what a wife knows can kill her. \nPUB DATE: 6/9/2020\n.\n.\nWill you be adding this to your list?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #booksandcoffee #bookaesthetic #thewifewhoknewtoomuch #bookish #booksleeve #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #ilovebooks #bookishlove #fortheloveofreading #whattoreadnext #cozy #thriller #booktography #bookpic #booklover #bookish #igreads #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #flatlay #booknerd #instalike #instareader #picoftheday #bookblogger #lifestyle",

There are very few things that I can’t read through. \nThis is a trigger book for a lot of people though, from what I’ve seen, so keep that in mind. .\n.\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nExploring the psychological dynamics of the relationship between a precocious yet naïve teenage girl and her magnetic and manipulative teacher, a brilliant, all-consuming read that marks the explosive debut of an extraordinary new writer.\n\n2000. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher. \n2017. Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?\n.\n.\n.\n#coffeeandcurrentlyreading #bookstagram #mydarkvanessa #booksandcoffee #bookaesthetic #whattoreadnext #bookstalove #booklover #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #reader #igreads #booksofig #booked #hygge #photography #bookpic #bookworm #bookaholic #bookaddict #lit #instadaily #instagood #bookblogger #picoftheday #lifestyle",

B. C. Murders, Patricia Highsmith’s Strangers on a Train, Ira Levin’s Death Trap, A. A. Milne's Red House Mystery, Anthony Berkeley Cox's Malice Aforethought, James M. Cain's Double Indemnity, John D. Macdonald's The Drowner, and Donna Tartt's A Secret History.\n\nBut no one is more surprised than Mal, now the owner of the Old Devils Bookstore in Boston, when an FBI agent comes knocking on his door one snowy day in February. She’s looking for information about a series of unsolved murders that look eerily similar to the killings on Mal’s old list. And the FBI agent isn’t the only one interested in this bookseller who spends almost every night at home reading. There is killer is out there, watching his every move—a diabolical threat who knows way too much about Mal’s personal history, especially the secrets he’s never told anyone, even his recently deceased wife.\n\nTo protect himself, Mal begins looking into possible suspects . . . and sees a killer in everyone around him. But Mal doesn’t count on the investigation leaving a trail of death in its wake. Suddenly, a series of shocking twists leaves more victims dead—and the noose around Mal’s neck grows so tight he might never escape.\n.\n.\n.\nPeter Swanson has quickly become one of my go-to authors and even though I couldn’t manage to score an arc of this beauty, I preordered a week ago cause #need . .\n.\nHappy reading #booksta friends!

But I do think it’s something everyone would find something to connect to.\n.\n.\n.\nI can’t imagine what the mother of a Columbine shooter would go through. As parents we feel and know that we will love our children through anything and everything. Even Ted Bundy’s mother loved him, though she was tormented by what he was.\nAnd that I imagine is sheer torture. \nWe hope to raise decent human beings. We know they won’t be perfect, but we expect that what at least some of what we instill will stick.\nIn the case of a parent who has a child with damaging, violent pathology, I’d assume there is so much guilt. \nI feel guilt on a daily basis. \nAm I doing enough, too much, making good memories more than bad. Will he grow up strong but empathetic, kind but wise.\nThe meanderings of the typical mom brain.\nBut if he were to do something devastating, something that affected many people.... what would that mean, how would I feel about this life that I put out into the world.... .\n.\nSue Klebold wrote a powerful memoir, very well structured.

She raised her siblings and they’ve thankfully flown the coop. All she has to do is finish fixing up the lake house her grandparents left her, sell it, and then she’s free.\n\nWhen a massive storm hits, she runs into a tall, dark and brooding stranger, Camden Reid. There’s a spark there, one that shocks her. Surprising her further, her sister and brother return, each of them holding their own secrets. The smart move would be for Piper to ignore them all but Cam unleashes emotions deep inside of her that she can’t deny, making her yearn for something she doesn’t understand. And her siblings…well, they need each other.\n\nOnly when the secrets come out, it changes everything Piper thinks she knows about her family, herself…and Cam. Can she find a way to outrun the demons? The answer is closer than she thinks—just as the new life she craves may have already begun.\n.\n.\nThis is part of a series but it can also be read as a stand-alone .\nI love anything that involves a strong sibling bond because that’s one of the most important things in my life, so I will probably be reading more of the series.\n.\n.\n.\n#qotd : are you close with your siblings?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. \n#almostjustfriends #booksofinstagram #beautiful #bookstagram #igreads #reader #bookphotography #goodvibes #coffee #coffeetime #booklover #aesthetic #bookcover #bookaddict #bookaholic #calm #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #booked #lit #literature #bibliophile #instagood #instadaily #picoftheday #bloggerstyle #lifestyle",

It’s been on my list for a while. \n#thrillerthursday .\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nThe truth is easy to miss, even when it’s right in front of us. As a forensic reconstructionist, Rory Moore sheds light on cold-case homicides by piecing together crime scene details others fail to see. Cleaning out her late father’s law office a week after his burial, she receives a call that plunges her into a decades-old case come to life once more. \nIn the summer of 1979, five Chicago women went missing. The predator, nicknamed The Thief, left no bodies and no clues behind—until police received a package from a mysterious woman named Angela Mitchell, whose unorthodox investigation skills appear to have led to his identity. But before police could question her, Angela disappeared. Forty years later, The Thief is about to be paroled for Angela’s murder—the only crime the DA could pin on him. As a former client of her father’s, Rory becomes reluctantly involved with the killer—though he continues to insist he didn’t murder Angela. Now he wants Rory to do what her father once promised: prove that Angela is, in fact, still alive.\n\nAs Rory begins reconstructing Angela’s last days, another killer emerges from the shadows, replicating those long-ago murders. With every startling discovery she makes, Rory becomes more deeply entangled in the enigma of Angela Mitchell—and in The Thief’s tormented mind. Drawing connections between past and present is the only way to stop the nightmare, but even Rory can’t be prepared for the full, terrifying truth that is emerging . .\nSuch a good book! .\n.\n#somechoosedarkness #thriller #bookstagram #bookish #mystery #thrillernerdigans #booknerd #bookworm #igreaders #igreads #reader #booksofinstagram #booklover #ilovebooks #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #instalike #instagood #picoftheday #bookblogger #lifestyle",

She was allergic to everything, used a wheelchair and practically lived at the hospital. Neighbors did all they could, holding fundraisers and offering shoulders to cry on, but no matter how many doctors, tests, or surgeries, no one could figure out what was wrong with Rose Gold.\n\nTurns out her mom, Patty Watts, was just a really good liar.\n\nAfter serving five years in prison, Patty gets out with nowhere to go and begs her daughter to take her in. The entire community is shocked when Rose Gold says yes.\n\nPatty insists all she wants is to reconcile their differences. She says she's forgiven Rose Gold for turning her in and testifying against her. But Rose Gold knows her mother. Patty Watts always settles a score.\n\nUnfortunately for Patty, Rose Gold is no longer her weak little darling...

Thank you so much @readit.loveit.swapit , your puppy stationery has me seeing hearts 😍.\n.\n.\nHolly Banks Full Of Angst:\nPer @goodreads \nHolly Banks could not have made a worse first impression on the seemingly perfect moms in her new affluent community, the Village of Primm. Turns out wearing pink piggy pajama bottoms while dropping off her kindergartener late to the first day of school wasn’t her best look.\n\nNot to mention Holly’s worried her husband may be having an affair, she can’t get her daughter to stop sucking her thumb, her hard-won film degree is collecting dust, and to top it all off, the power-hungry PTA president clearly has it in for her…\n\nTo make matters even worse, Holly’s natural eye for drama lands her smack-dab in the middle of a neighborhood mystery—right as her own crazy mother shows up in Primm “to help.” Through it all, Holly begins to realize her neighbors may be just as flawed as—and even wackier than—she is, leaving her to wonder: Is there such a thing as a perfect mom? .\n.\nThis blurb! Ok as a mom I see how crazy it’s gotten. To be perfect, especially social media perfect.\n.\n.\n\nI will never, ever forget the party we took my then two year old son to, and we’re told by another mom that we had been taken off the guest list for another party because my son didn’t fit “the image”. .\n.\nTha fuq??? My sisters and my mom had a field day with this person because well, it’s insane. But I’m constantly reminded that’s what we are around. Parents who seem to care about the wrong things, and pay little attention to whether their children are kind, respectful, responsible humans.\n.\n.\nAm I the perfect momma?\nNope. In that realm, perfection doesn’t exist.\nBut I do hope that I teach my son the important things in life and that they stick.\n.\n.\nThanks again for the win @readit.loveit.swapit !!!

I haven’t completed nearly as many as I did last year. .\n.\nI am dealing with some depression so there’s that. But I also have ARC’s and books that authors have sent me which I so appreciate!! I think I look at that stack though and just feel slightly overwhelmed. .\n.\nSo I put everything aside and started a book that I’ve wanted to read for quite a few years.\nIf you’ve watched the movie, show, read the book etc, the character Jack Crawford is slightly based on John Douglas. The same John Douglas that Holden from Mindhunter is based on. \nJohn E. Douglas to be more specific. The retired FBI agent who I’m kinda obsessed with.\n.\n.\nAnyhow, I think I need to just read.

With no father in the picture, her mom's advice has been her only true north. But when professional failure leads Emily back to Nantucket to renovate and sell the family cottage she inherited, she wonders if her mom left advice to cover this . . . especially when her grandmother arrives to \"supervise.\" And especially when her heart becomes entangled with Hollis McGuire, the boy next door-turned-baseball star who's back on the island after a career-ending injury.\n\nAs sparks fly between her and Hollis, Emily is drawn to island life, even as she uncovers shocking secrets about the tragic accident that led to her mother's death.

I can read Jane Austen but the new stuff ... not for me. \nI digress.\n.\n.\n.\nCan I really give five stars to a contemporary romance? \nWhy yes I can.\n.\n.\n.\nAlex is the son of Ellen, President of the United States (I know, cool right??? Finally a female president😂),\nHenry is a prince of England. \nBoth in their early twenties, both the face of their particular dynasty.\nAnd they hate each other.\nWhen something happens to force them together to save global face so to speak. .\n.\nThey end up realizing they have more in common than they thought. They are both shackled by the constraints of their fame.\nSo cliche right?????\nWrong.\n.\n.\nThis book has some fluff, but it’s excusable somehow. \nIt also broaches extremely important topics like quite obviously the rigors of fame. But also things like being true to self, figuring out who you are which I think your twenties are for.\nAnd LBGTQ. \nI don’t care what side of religion or politics you fall on, I feel like it’s important to realize that people are harming themselves and worse, because they don’t feel like they can express who they are to the important people in their lives. .\n.\n.\n\nMost important in this life is kindness. Understanding. You never, ever know what a person is going through. Celebrities may look like they have it all, but this book poignantly points out their lives come at a price.\n.\n\nI am glad I gave this book a chance because it was just the right balance of fun and substance.\nIt is the first pink spine I own!\n.\n.\n.\n#redwhiteandroyalblue #lgbt #bookstagram #lit #bookreview #love #romance #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #bookworm #pretty #coffee #coffeetime #booklover #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #instabook #igreads #igreaders #bookish #bibliophile #pink #aesthetic #instalike #instalove #bloggerstyle #lifestyle #picoftheday",

The premise is not what I thought when I initially spotted the cover on goodreads. .\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nAlix Chamberlain is a woman who gets what she wants and has made a living showing other women how to do the same. A mother to two small girls, she started out as a blogger and has quickly built herself into a confidence-driven brand. So she is shocked when her babysitter, Emira Tucker, is confronted while watching the Chamberlains’ toddler one night. Seeing a young black woman out late with a white child, a security guard at their local high-end supermarket accuses Emira of kidnapping two-year-old Briar. A small crowd gathers, a bystander films everything, and Emira is furious and humiliated. Alix resolves to make it right.\n\nBut Emira herself is aimless, broke, and wary of Alix’s desire to help. At twenty-five, she is about to lose her health insurance and has no idea what to do with her life. When the video of Emira unearths someone from Alix’s past, both women find themselves on a crash course that will upend everything they think they know about themselves, and each other.\n\nWith empathy and piercing social commentary, Such a Fun Age explores the stickiness of transactional relationships, what it means to make someone “family,” the complicated reality of being a grown up, and the consequences of doing the right thing for the wrong reason. .\n.\nI can’t wait to get to this one. \nAnd cocoa.

So much fun though. \nThere was an awesome coffee festival here in town on Saturday morning and I was in coffee heaven.\n.\n.\nChristmas is getting so close!\nSo I got myself a book for Christmas.\nCause there’s no Santa for grownups. #sorrynotsorry .\n.\nBOOK SYNOPSIS:\nA sensational crime, a missing teen, and a mother and daughter with no one to trust but themselves come together in this shocking debut thriller by R. H. Herron. “Mama? Help me.” Laurie Ahmadi has worked as a 911 police dispatcher in her quiet Northern California town for nearly two decades. She considers the department her family; her husband, Omid, is its first Arab American chief, and their teenaged daughter, Jojo, has grown up with the force. So when Laurie catches a 911 call and, to her horror, it’s Jojo, the whole department springs into action.\n\nJojo, drugged, disoriented, and in pain, doesn’t remember how she ended up at the home of Kevin Leeds, a pro football player famous for his on-the-field activism and his work with the CapB—“Citizens Against Police Brutality”—movement. She doesn’t know what happened to Kevin’s friend and trainer, whose beaten corpse is also discovered in the house. And she has no idea where her best friend Harper, who was with her earlier in the evening, could be.\n\nBut when Jojo begins to dive into Harper’s social media to look for clues to her whereabouts, Jojo uncovers a shocking secret that turns everything she knew about Harper—and the police department—on its head. With everything they thought they could rely on in question, Laurie and Jojo begin to realize that they can’t trust anyone to find Harper except themselves . . . and time is running out. .\n.\nHave you read this? Mixed reviews but that doesn’t deter me too often.

Part of the arrangement is that they aren’t supposed to know anything about each other.\n.\n.\nI spent the beginning of the book disgusted by the narrators willingness to “roll over” both literally and figuratively, for a man.

Because I typically read darker dramas or thrillers. .\nSYNOPSIS:\nFollowing a year in the life of a twenty-something British woman who falls hard for her London flat mate, this clever, fun, and unforgettable romantic comedy is the perfect feel-good holiday read.\n\nTwo people. One house. A year that changes everything. \nTwenty-nine-year-old Jess is following her dream and moving to London. It’s December, and she’s taking a room in a crumbling, but grand, Notting Hill house-share with four virtual strangers. On her first night, Jess meets Alex, the guy sharing her floor, at a Christmas dinner hosted by her landlord. They don’t kiss, but as far as Jess is concerned the connection is clear. She starts planning how they will knock down the wall between them to spend more time together.\n\nBut when Jess returns from a two-week Christmas holiday, she finds Alex has started dating someone else—beautiful Emma, who lives on the floor above them. Now Jess faces a year of bumping into (hell, sharing a bathroom with) the man of her dreams…and the woman of his. .\n.\nCute!\n.\n.\nI hope everyone who celebrates Thanksgiving had a wonderful one and everyone else, I hope it was a great day. .\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #december #bookclub #bibliophile #bookphotography #bookish #romance #love #booklover #bookaholic #winteriscoming #bookworm #read #readersofinstagram #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #coffee #cozy #booksofinstagram #ilovebooks #instalike #photography #flatlay #bookstabuddies📚 #BookSharks  #instalove #picoftheday #bookblogger #lifestyle",

I connected with it so I got it. .\nSYNOPSIS:\nAn “insidious, suspenseful tale” (J.T. Ellison) with a “shocker of an ending you won’t see coming” (Michele Campbell), Because You're Mine by Rea Frey, the author who “brings to mind Jodi Picoult” (Booklist) and “will appeal to readers of Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen” (Sally Hepworth) is a novel about how the truth will set you free.\n\nBut it’s the lies that keep you safe. \nSingle mother Lee has the daily routine down to a science: shower in six minutes. Cut food into perfect squares. Never leave her on-the-spectrum son Mason in someone else’s care. She’ll do anything—anything—to keep his carefully constructed world from falling apart. Do anything to keep him safe.\n\nBut when her best friend Grace convinces her she needs a small break from motherhood to recharge her batteries, Lee gives in to a weekend trip. Surely a long weekend away from home won’t hurt?\nNoah, Mason’s handsome, bright, charismatic tutor—the first man in ages Lee’s even noticed—is more than happy to stay with him.\n\nForty-eight hours later, someone is dead.\n\nBut not all is as it seems. Noah may be more than who he claims to be. Grace has a secret—one that will destroy Lee. Lee has secrets of her own that she will do anything to keep hidden.\nAs the dominoes begin to fall and the past comes to light, perhaps it's no mystery someone is gone after all…\n\nBecause You're Mine is a breathtaking novel of domestic drama and suspense. \nPrepare to stay up all night. -per @goodreads .\n.\nI’m very much a mood reader. I don’t plan reads, I just pick up what strikes my fancy next. So I have no idea when I’ll get to this one. It might be the next book I read! Who knows.\n.\n.\n\nAre you a mood reader?

The #PSL is delicious and mild and I don’t care who hates it lol. .\n.\n.\nI put this book aside a few months ago and I’m so glad I picked it back up. \n@mlouuuise you definitely have good taste in books baby sis.\n.\n\nSmall synopsis if you don’t know: an agoraphobic woman watches her neighbors comings and goings and then sees something she shouldn’t. .\n.\nAs @subakka.bookstuff points out, the author utilizes the “unreliable narrator”. Though I can see where that may be irksome for some, I don’t actually mind it! \nSometimes I feel like it adds to the suspense layering. .\n.\nWhat I especially like about this book is the fairly accurate depiction and description of agoraphobia, which I have. Hint: it’s not just fear of open spaces. I related immensely to her wishes of being able to do anything, much less leave her home. I too am lucky to have a husband who has always supported me emotionally and financially, so I don’t have to worry about anything other than being well. \nI won’t give too much away but I really did enjoy this book. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #latte #starbucks #bookish #bookstabuddies📚 #booksharks #reading #literature #nature #photography #thriller #suspense #bibliophile #texas #sanantonio #satxbloggers #bookaholic #booklover #love #instalike #instalove #picoftheday #lifestyle #beautiful #igreads",

            "text": "👤SATURDAY👤\n.\n.\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\nThis is a five star read for me. I’m a true crime junkie and John Douglas is just a master in that field. This book combines procedural technique with accounts from the many, many criminals he’s sat with and talked to. If not for Douglas and his team, we wouldn’t have the term “serial killer” nor the in depth access to profiling these criminals. The man is a genius when it comes to noticing everything and using it. From Manson he learned how to give certain people the feeling of power, and how to identify who needed that feeling. \nDouglas read that David berkowitz (son of Sam) had insecurity issues. So he showed him a recent newspaper featuring BTK (not yet identified) and said “this guy uses your name in his letters to the police, he wants to feel powerful like you”.\nBerkowitz sang like a canary.\n.\n.\n.\n\nWhether or not you like this genre or would ever read it, the research definitely has affected everything about how we track, profile and interview criminals. Whether or not we want them to, they exist. And it takes people like John Douglas, Ann Burgess, and the late Robert Ressler (the very three that the show Mindhunter is predicated upon) to do the dirty work and figure out what makes these people tick, the goal being to identify said characters before they commit heinous crime. .\n.\nWarning: this book is graphic in its detail when discussing its cases. I highly recommend and like this book but it is a tough read in some ways.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #crime #nonfiction #outdoors #photography #sanantonio #satxbloggers #bookish #truecrime #law #mindhunter #read #igreads #water #bookaholic #booksharks #readingchallenge #readersofinstagram #lifestyle #influencer #picoftheday #bloggerstyle #instalike #instalove #truecrimejunkie #bibliophile #bookreview",

And this still stands out as one of my favorites. It’s odd, hard to get through for some. But I was much more patient in my younger years. .\n.\nSYNOPSIS:\nThe novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea, west of Italy. The novel looks into the experiences of Yossarian and the other airmen in the camp, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home....\n.\n.\n.\nA CATCH 22— A catch-22 is a paradoxical situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules or limitations. ... Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to, but has no control over, because to fight the rule is to accept it.\n.\n.\nI’ve always enjoyed that concept 😏\n.\nHappy Friday my dears, may your weekend be brilliant ❤️\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #catch22 #coffee #coffeecup #raedunn #bookish #igreads #goodreads #readersofinstagram #reader #booksofinstagram #bookphotography #bookworm #bookaholic #booklover #booksandcoffee #love #instalike #instalove #instagood #influencer #bookblog #lifestyle #booksharks",

She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up\n— she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.\n\nRyle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.\n\nAs questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. 🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁\nIt’s the first cold day of the season!

The others really didn’t appeal to me, and quite honestly neither did this one. \nI was put off by the “magical realism” label.\nBut I researched the book and then the term.\nBoth seemed right up my alley. 🔥\nMagical realism differs from fantasy in that the magic occurs in a realistic setting. It is simply accepted as fact within the setting. Examples are One Hundred Years of Solitude, and even the Harry Potter series. 🔥\nBOOK SYNOPSIS:\n\nLillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.\n\nMadison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth.\n\nThinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?\n.\n.\n.\nWhat’s a book that you were surprised to have liked?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #magic #bibliophile #bookish #bookcover #aesthetic #art #reader #igreads #read #bookworm #bookofthemonth #botm #love #bookphotography #photography #bookaholic #booknerd #instalike #instalove #instafollow #influencer #picoftheday #bloggerstyle #lifestyle #coffeeandcurrentlyreading #booksharks",

I saw that term floating around #bookstagram and thought, that’s perfect! Lust List. Book hungry we are. .\n.\n.\n@goodreads BOOK SYNOPSIS:\nElsa is seven years old and different. Her grandmother is seventy-seven years old and crazy, standing-on-the-balcony-firing-paintball-guns-at-men-who-want-to-talk-about-Jesus-crazy. She is also Elsa's best, and only, friend. At night Elsa takes refuge in her grandmother's stories, in the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas where everybody is different and nobody needs to be normal.\n\nWhen Elsa's grandmother dies and leaves behind a series of letters apologizing to people she has wronged, Elsa's greatest adventure begins. Her grandmother's letters lead her to an apartment building full of drunks, monsters, attack dogs, and totally ordinary old crones, but also to the truth about fairytales and kingdoms and a grandmother like no other. .\n.\nSeems adorable.

Instinct proves reliable. A murderous sociopath, Edgler Foreman Vess, has entered the house, intent on killing everyone inside. A self-proclaimed \"homicidal adventurer,\" Vess lives only to satisfy all appetites as they arise, to immerse himself in sensation, to live without fear, remorse or limits, to live with \"intensity.\" Chyna is trapped in his deadly orbit. \nChyna is a survivor, toughened by a lifelong struggle for safety and self-respect. Now she will be tested as never before. At first her sole aim is to get out alive--until, by chance, she learns the identity of Vess's next intended victim, a faraway innocent only she can save. Driven by a newly discovered thirst for meaning beyond mere self-preservation, Chyna musters every inner resource she has to save an endangered girl...as moment by moment, the terrifying threat of Edgler Foreman Vess intensifies.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #falldecor #mystery #suspense #thriller #bookish #booklover #igreads #flatlay #bookaddict #igreads #bookworm #read #reader #fallvibes #bookaholic #targetstyle #love #influencer #instalike #instalove #bookblogger #lifestyle #picoftheday #booksparks",

Twelve-year-old Rill Foss and her four younger siblings live a magical life aboard their family’s Mississippi River shantyboat. But when their father must rush their mother to the hospital one stormy night, Rill is left in charge—until strangers arrive in force. Wrenched from all that is familiar and thrown into a Tennessee Children’s Home Society orphanage, the Foss children are assured that they will soon be returned to their parents—but they quickly realize the dark truth. At the mercy of the facility’s cruel director, Rill fights to keep her sisters and brother together in a world of danger and uncertainty.\n\nAiken, South Carolina, present day. Born into wealth and privilege, Avery Stafford seems to have it all: a successful career as a federal prosecutor, a handsome fiancé, and a lavish wedding on the horizon. But when Avery returns home to help her father weather a health crisis, a chance encounter leaves her with uncomfortable questions and compels her to take a journey through her family’s long-hidden history, on a path that will ultimately lead either to devastation or to redemption.\n\nBased on one of America’s most notorious real-life scandals—in which Georgia Tann, director of a Memphis-based adoption organization, kidnapped and sold poor children to wealthy families all over the country—Lisa Wingate’s riveting, wrenching, and ultimately uplifting tale reminds us how, even though the paths we take can lead to many places, the heart never forgets where we belong. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #book #bookphotography #photography #love #reading #read #bookish #libros #aesthetic #bookaholic #booklover #bookworm #booknerd #drama #igreads #style #instalike #instalove #inspo #instafollow #bloggerstyle #lifestyle #influencer #picoftheday #booksharks",

They decide to take a year off in the hopes of finding a way to fall in love again. One year apart, and only one rule: they cannot contact each other. Aside from that, anything goes.\n\nLauren embarks on a journey of self-discovery, quickly finding that her friends and family have their own ideas about the meaning of marriage. These influences, as well as her own healing process and the challenges of living apart from Ryan, begin to change Lauren’s ideas about monogamy and marriage. She starts to question: When you can have romance without loyalty and commitment without marriage, when love and lust are no longer tied together, what do you value? What are you willing to fight for?\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMarriage is tough y’all, if yours is easy then I am so happy for you. But for most people it’s two people with different ideas about everything trying to build a life together while fighting over who takes out the trash more. \nHa! Is it worth it? Damn right.

My gosh i wanted to take him lol.\nAnyhow ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5.\nHighly recommend if you’re looking for some gritty substance.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #bibliophile #book #nature #sanantonio #satxbloggers #bookish #bookworm #bookphotography #book #read #aesthetic #bookworm #bookaholic #outdoors #photography #bookclub #booksharks #instalike #instalove #influencer #bloggerstyle #lifestyle #booklover #instafollow #igreads #love #askagainyeswearestillreading",

Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life.\n\nBut the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after?\n\nIn her most ambitious novel yet, Jennifer Weiner tells a story of two sisters who, with their different dreams and different paths, offer answers to the question: How should a woman be in the world? .\n.\n.\nOk guys, I must not like contemporary romance because I’m not really enjoying “The Bride Test”.\nI seem to veer towards drama or historical fiction or anything quirky and/or endearing. \nI’m tempted to put it down and pick it up later but I’m 100 pages in. What do y’all think? Trudge on? \nUgh. \nMaybe I have a case of the Monday’s ...😏\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#book #bookish #bookstagram #igreads #bookphotography #reading #read #bookworm #bookaholic #bookshelf #booksharks #summerreading #love #interiors #style #bookaddict #booknerd #instalike #instalove #influencer #picoftheday #photography #instafollow #bookblogger #lifestyle #instafollow",

But the beatings and threats started even before then.\n.\n.\n.\nShe took the abuse because she was from a traditional catholic family that didn’t believe in divorce.\n“What did you do to anger him or deserve it”, was a common theme in those circles. \nMy momma tried to tell her momma but was brushed off.\nAnd she lost her nerve. The one person who should have protected her, told her to go home to her husband.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nBut something happened with me that my mother never speaks of, only that it gave her the strength to leave. She knew she had to get me out. .\n.\nI later found out that while we were packing, my father woke up, hung over as usual, but my mother poured him a glass of milk and sweet-talked him back to sleep.\n.\n.\nShe was 22. \nAt 22 I was still going on yearly ski trips with my boyfriend.\n.\n.\nI remember things from that day vividly, the last left turn that took us forever from the house on Longfellow street. .\n.\nMy mother made it, unlike Isra.\n.\n.\nYes this story is about the Arab culture. But many cultures teach similar lifestyles.\n.\n. \nI’m proud to know a woman as brave as my mother and I don’t know what I would have done in her shoes. But I thank God every day that she had so much courage. My life is different because of that brave girl so long ago.\n.\n.\nI love you momma.

It took years to forgive her for many, valid issues I had. And then when I knew I would never get any apologies or even acknowledgement of the past, a past which broke me into a thousand slivers, I let it go for my own peace and gave her grace. .\n.\n.\nMichelle and I didn’t have similar mothers , but it seems that we had similar experiences upon becoming new mommas. The realization that no matter what transgresses in the future, that new baby is your world and you want everything for them.\nAnd there’s a realization that it’s really freakin hard!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAfter I had my son, with my husband never leaving our sides, and also taking care of our newborn because I was out of commission from almost deadly complications, I thought of my own momma.\n18 years old with a newborn, all by herself most of the time, with an abusive husband.\nAnd then I bawled.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI wanted to go back in time, be her friend, love her, help her.\nMy God she must have felt so alone.\nAnd yet she took care of a preemie newborn, figuring things out along the way. \nAs I write this, I can scarcely see through my tears.\n.\n.\n.\nI knew then that I would never again hold any ill will towards my mother. Only love. \nShe was so damaged from that part of her life, I can’t imagine what that experience was and still may be for her. \nPerhaps I reminded her of it too much. And perhaps the naturally practical and bold human that I am, just didn’t mesh with the sensitive, almost little girl qualities that my momma has.\nWhatever the case, I don’t care. I will love and honor that woman with everything I am as long as I have her.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #wordsofwisdom #momlife #bookish #reading #bookphotography #bookworm #bookcommunity #photography #influencer #love #forgiveness #bookaholic #read #instalike #instalove #picoftheday #blogger #lifestyle #life #instafollow #bookaddict #reader #words",

It’s become much more difficult for a lot of Americans to get out, I won’t get political but s**t is expensive! \nWhen I was younger I could get on a plane for $200 round trip and spend a summer somewhere. But I’m almost 40, so things have obviously changed considerably in my lifetime. Never in American history has it been so expensive just to survive.\nBut I hope that changes. And I hope we are able to give my son the experiences I had. Because the places and spaces I’ve seen have shaped my views. I’m an avid reader and travel has enhanced my visions of the worlds I read about.\nNarnia seems far more real ;)\n.\n.\n#photography #coffee #momsofinstagram #momswithcameras #coffeelover #coffeelife #travel #wanderlust #flowers #coffeeoftheday #coffeetime #lifestyleblogger #lifestyle #momblogger #coffeecup #instapic #instalike #instagood #instacoffee #influencer #coffeeshop #everyday #adventure #picoftheday #instafollow #blogger #instablogger #photographer",

I used to have a book in my hand, likely a dystopian novel or some classic the likes of Dickens.\n\nMy world has changed. And oh how happy I am. There are still books in my hands on rainy days, but there is another set of tiny hands to help turn the pages. And they have titles like “12 Little Monkeys” or “Love You Forever”. Though the literature has changed, my love of rainy days with a cup of coffee in my midst and a pile of books to read, has only grown with the addition of my own little boy to share it with. I lead a charmed life😊.\nPluviophile...❤️ #obscurewords .\n.\n.\n#goodmorning #coffeegram #letitrain #words #coffeequotes #quotes #quoteoftheday #poetry #coffeelover #coffeelife #instacoffee #instaquote #bloggerstyle #momblogger #momlife #coffeeaddict #blogger #influencer #loveyourlife #coffee #instalike #instadaily #instagood #instafollow #wanderlust #rain #love #lifestyle #bookstagram",
